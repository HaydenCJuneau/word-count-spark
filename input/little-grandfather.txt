little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,CHAPTER I.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,THE PARLINS.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,He did look so funny when they first put him into "pocket-clothes!" His
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,green "breeches" were so tight that they made you think of two pods of
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,marrow-fat peas, only they were topped off with a pair of "rocco" shoes,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,as red as bell-peppers. He had silver buckles on his shoes, and brass
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,buttons on his green jacket, which was fastened at the back. He had a
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,white collar about his neck as large as a small cape, and finished off
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,around the edge with a ruffle. His mother had snipped his dark locks so
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,they needn't look so much like a girl's; and then with his brown fur hat
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,on, which his grandfather Cheever had sent from Boston, he looked in the
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,glass and smiled at himself.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Do you wonder he smiled?
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,He had bright black eyes, red cheeks, and a rich, dark skin. He was a
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,handsome little creature; but when he was tanned, his brother Stephen
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,called him a "Pawnee Indian," which was a heavy joke, and sank deeper
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,into Willy's tender soul than Stephen suspected.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,After he had viewed himself in the mirror, dressed in his new suit, he
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,ran to his best comforter, his mother, and said, with a quivering lip,--
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Isn't I _most_ white, mamma?"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,His mother caught him to her breast and hugged him, brown fur hat and
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,all, and told him he mustn't mind Steenie's jokes; he was not an Indian,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,and Molly Molasses--the squaw who came around with baskets to
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,sell--would never carry him off.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,He was three years old at this time, and so full of high spirits and
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,health, that he was rather a troublesome child to manage. Mrs. Parlin
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,sometimes remarked, with a sigh and a smile,--
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"I don't know what I _shall_ do with our Willy!"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,If she had said, "I don't know what I should do without him," it would
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,have been nearer the truth; for never did mother dote more on a child.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,He was the youngest, and two little children next older--a son and a
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,daughter--had been called to their heavenly home before he was born.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,People said Mrs. Parlin was in a fair way to spoil Willy, and her
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,husband was so afraid of it, that he felt it his duty to be very stern
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,with the boy.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Seth, the oldest son, helped his father in this, and seemed to be
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,constantly watching to see what Willy would do that was wrong.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Stephen, two years younger than Seth, was not so severe, and hardly ever
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,scolded, but had a very "hectoring disposition," and loved dearly to
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,tease his little brother.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Love, the only sister, and the eldest of the family, was almost as
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,soothing and affectionate to Willy as Mrs. Parlin herself. She was tall,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,fair, and slender, like a lily, and you could hardly believe it possible
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,that she would ever grow to be such a very large woman as her mother,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,or that Mrs. Parlin had once been thin and delicate, like Love.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,There was another, besides these two, who petted Willy; and that was
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Liddy," the housemaid. Lydia was a Quaker woman, and every "First Day"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,and "Fifth Day"--that is, Sunday and Thursday--she went off to a
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,meeting, which was held over the river, three miles away, in a yellow
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"meeting-house" without any steeple. It was not always convenient to
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,spare Lydia on "Fifth Day," for, Mr. Parlin kept a country hotel, or, as
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,it was called in those days, a "tavern," and there was plenty of work to
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,be done; but no matter how much company came, "Liddy" would leave her
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,pies half rolled out on the board, or her goose half stuffed, and walk
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,off to the Quaker settlement to meeting. But when she came back, she
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,went steadily to work again, and was such a good, honest, pious woman,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,that nobody thought of finding any fault with her.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,She was all the "regular help" Mrs. Parlin had; but Mrs. Knowles did the
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,washing, and often Siller Noonin came in to help Lydia with an extra
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,baking.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Caleb Cushing--or, as the country people called him, "Kellup"--was the
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,man of all work, who took care of the sheep and cattle, and must always
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,be ready to "put up" the horses of any traveller who happened to stop at
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,the house.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Mr. and Mrs. Parlin, the four children, and Caleb and Lydia, made up the
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,household, with the addition of great shaggy Fowler, the dog, and
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,speckled Molly, the cat, with double fore-paws.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Grandfather Cheever, with his hair done up in a queue, came sometimes
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,from Boston, and made a long visit; but you could hardly say he belonged
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,to the family.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Now, my story is to be about Willy, and I would like to describe him;
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,but how can I, when I have heard such various accounts of the child? I
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,suppose, if you had questioned the family about him, you would have
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,heard a different story from every one. His father would have shaken his
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,head, and said, Willy was a "singular child; there was no _regulation_
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,to him." Seth would have told you he was "impudent." Stephen would have
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,called him "a cry-baby," and Caleb, "the laziest little chap he ever
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,came across;" though "grandf'ther Cheever" thought him "very bright and
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,stirring." Love would have said, "He is _so_ affectionate!" which his
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,father very much doubted. Lydia might possibly have called him a
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"rogue," because he would spy out her doughnuts and pies, no matter
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,where she hid them away for safe keeping.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,But I know very well how his _mother_ would have answered your question
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,about Willy. She would have said, "Don't talk of his faults; he is my
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,own little darling."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,And then she would have opened her arms wide, and taken him right in:
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,that is the way it is with mothers.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Thus you see our Willy was not the same to everybody; and no child ever
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,is. To those who loved him he was "sweet as summer;" but not so to those
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,who loved him not.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,I suspect Willy was rather contrarily made up; something like a mince
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,pie, perhaps. Let us see.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Short and crusty, now and then; rich, in good intentions; sweet, when he
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,had his own way; sour, when you crossed him; well-spiced, with bright
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,little speeches. All these qualities made up Willy's "points;" and you
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,know a mince pie is good for nothing without points.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Some people brought out one of these "points," and some another. Seth
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,expected him to be as sharp as cider vinegar; and so I am afraid he was,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,whenever Seth corrected him. But his mother looked for sweet qualities
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,in her little darling, and was never disappointed.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Willy slept in the bedroom, in a trundle-bed which had held every one of
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,the children, from the oldest to the youngest. After he had said his
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,prayers, Mrs. Parlin tucked him up nice and warm, and even while she
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,stood looking at his rosy cheeks, with the rich fringes of his eyelids
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,resting on them, he often dropped off into dreamland. She had a way of
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,watching him in his sleep, and blessing him without any words, only
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,saying in her heart,--
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Dear God, let me keep this last precious treasure! But if that may not
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,be, O, lay it up for me in heaven."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Willy was afraid to go to bed alone, which is hardly to be wondered at;
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,for he had a strange and dreadful habit of walking in his sleep. Such
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,habits are not as common now as they were in old times, I believe.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Whether Willy's walks had anything to do with the cider and doughnuts,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,which were sometimes given him in the evening, unknown to his mother, I
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,cannot say; but Mrs. Parlin was never sure, when she "tucked" him into
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,his trundle-bed, that he would spend the night there. Quite as likely he
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,would go wandering about the house; and one cold winter, when he was a
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,little more than seven years old, he got up regularly every night, and
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,walked fast asleep into the bar-room, which was always full of men, and
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,took his seat by the fireplace.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,This was such a constant habit, that the men expected to see him about
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,half past eight o'clock, just as much as they expected to see the cider
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,and apples which "Kellup" brought out of the cellar.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,In those days cider was almost as freely drunk as water, and so, I
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,grieve to say, was New England rum and brandy; and you must not suppose
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Mr. Parlin was a bad man because he allowed such drinking in his
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,bar-room. There were no pledges signed in those days, but he was a
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,perfectly temperate man, and a church member; he would have thought it
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,very strange indeed if any one had told him he was doing wrong to sell
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,liquor to his neighbors.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,And now, having introduced Master Willy and the rest of the family as
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,well as I can, I will go on to tell you a few of Willy's adventures,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,some of which occurred while he was asleep, and some while he was
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,awake.

little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,CHAPTER II.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,WALKING IN SLEEP.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,About seven o'clock, one cold evening, Willy was in the bar-room,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,sitting on Caleb's knee, and holding a private conversation with him,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,while he nibbled a cookie.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Don't you think it's the beautifulest bossy ever you saw?"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Well, middlin' handsome," replied Caleb, mischievously; "middlin'
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,handsome."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"O, Caleb, when it's got a white place in its forehead shaped _so_!"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,said Willy, biting his cookie into something like the form of a star.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Well, yes; you see he'd be quite a decent-looking calf, if it wasn't
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,for that white streak, now," said Caleb, in a tone of regret.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"If it _wasn't_ for that white streak! Why, Caleb Cushing!--when 'twas
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,put there to purpose to be kissed! Love said so."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Well, everybody to their fancy," returned Caleb, dryly. "I never had
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,any notion for kissing cattle, myself."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"She isn't a cattle, Cale Cushing. She's my bossy."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Yours, do you say? Then you'd better take care of him, Willy. He walked
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,up to the kitchen door to-day, to see if he could find anything there to
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,lay his hands on."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Hands? He hasn't any hands, Caleb! But you ought to take care of her,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,any way, till I grow a man; father spects you to. And then, when she
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,gets to be a ox--"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Well, what are you going to do when she gets to be a ox?"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Willy looked puzzled. He had never thought of that before.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Have him killed--shan't you, sonny? He'll make very nice eating."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Willy stood upright on Caleb's knee, in horror and amaze.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"My bossy killed? I'll send anybody to jail that kills that bossy."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Then perhaps you'd better trade him off now to Squire Lyman. Didn't the
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,squire offer to swap his baby for him?"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Yes; and so I would if that baby was a boy," said Willy, thoughtfully;
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"but she's only a girl--couldn't help me bring in chips, you know.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Guess I don't want a girl-baby."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Caleb laughed at this very quietly, but his whole frame was shaking; and
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Willy turned round and looked him in the eye with strong displeasure.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"What you laughing at, Cale Cushing? You mustn't make fun of my bossy.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,I'll tell you what I'll do with her. I'll keep her to haul hay with."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Did you ever see one ox hauling hay alone, Willy?"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"No; but I'll have a little cart, and then she can."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"But the trouble is, Willy, your ox might feel lonesome."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Well, I'll buy one ox more, and then he won't be lonesome."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Ah! but, Willy, oxen cost money."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"'Sif I didn't know that! How much money do they cost, Caleb?"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Sometimes more, sometimes less. Pretty high this winter, for hay is
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,plenty. There was a man along from the west'ard, and, Willy, what think
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,he offered your pa for that brindled yoke of his?"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Three dollars?"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Seventy-five dollars; and your pa wouldn't let 'em go under ninety!
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Think of that," added Caleb, dropping his voice, and appearing to talk
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,to the beech-wood fire, which was crackling in the big fireplace. "Think
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,of that! Ninety dollars! Enough to buy a small farm! Just what I should
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,have got in the logging-swamp, winter before last, if Dascom hadn't
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,cheated me out of it."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"What did you say, Caleb?"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"O, I was just talking to myself," replied Caleb, rather bitterly. "It
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,wasn't anything little boys should hear. I was only thinking how easy
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,money comes to some folks, and how hard it comes to others. You see I
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,worked a whole winter once, and never got a cent of pay; and I couldn't
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,help feeling it when your pa put that ninety dollars away in his
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,drawer."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"You didn't want my father's money--did you, Caleb Cushing?"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"No, child; only I knew if I'd had justice done me, I should have had
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,ninety dollars myself. It was mine by good rights, and I hadn't ought to
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,be cheated out of it."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Willy looked up astonished. What did Caleb mean by saying it was "his by
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,good rights"?--his father's money. For he had not heard all Caleb's
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,remarks, and what he had heard he had entirely misunderstood.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Willy!" called his mother's voice from the sitting-room; but the little
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,fellow, was too excited to hear.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Do you mean my father's money, Caleb, that he keeps in his drawer?"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Yes, yes, child; laid inside of a book," replied Caleb, carelessly.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"What! and you want it?--my father's money?"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Yes, yes," laughed Caleb; "off to bed, child. Don't you hear your
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,mother calling?"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Willy slipped down from the man's knee, and walked out of the room in
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,deep thought. Why Caleb should want his father's money, and say he had
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,a right to it, was more than he could understand; and he went to sleep
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,with his little brain in a whirl.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Very soon tired and chilly teamsters began to pour into the bar-room,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,and rub their hands before the roaring fire. Caleb, who had quite
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,forgotten his unlucky conversation with Master Willy, put fresh wood on
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,the andirons, and brushed the hearth with a strip broom. Presently Mr.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Parlin himself appeared in the doorway, bearing a huge pitcher of cider,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,which sparkled in a jolly way, as if it were glad to leave its hogshead
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,prison in the dark cellar, and come up into such lively company.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Well, neighbors, this is a cold evening," said Mr. Parlin, setting the
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,pitcher down on the counter, and looking round with a hospitable smile.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Caleb, fetch out the loggerhead."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Caleb drew from the left ear of the fireplace a long iron bar, and
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,thrust it into the hot coals. That was the loggerhead, and you will soon
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,see what it was used for.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,While it was still heating, Dr. Hilton took from one corner of the room
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,a child's arm-chair, and set it down at a comfortable distance from the
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,fireplace.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"We'll have it all ready for Bubby, when he makes us his visit," said
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,he, laughing.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Some one always placed the chair there for Willy, and it was usually Dr.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Hilton.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,When the loggerhead was red hot, Caleb drew it out of the coals, and
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,plunged it into the cold cider, which immediately began to bubble and
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,hiss. Then he poured the sparkling liquid into mugs for the thirsty
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,teamsters to drink; and while he was still holding the pitcher high in
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,air, that the cider might come down with a good "bead," the door slowly
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,opened, and in glided Willy, in his yellow flannel night-dress.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,The men smiled and nodded at one another, but said nothing, as the child
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,crossed the floor, seated himself in the little red chair, and began to
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,rock. He rocked with such careless grace, and held his little feet
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,before the blaze so naturally, that you would have thought he came into
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,the room merely to warm his toes and to hear the men talk. You would
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,never have supposed he was asleep unless you had looked at his eyes.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,They were wide open, it is true, but fixed, like a doll's eyes. If you
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,had held a lighted candle before them, I suppose they would not have
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,winked.

little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,In fact, Willy was fast asleep and dreaming; and all the difference
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,between him and other sleepers was, that he acted out his dreams.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Queer what ails that child! Must be trouble on the brain, and he ought
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,to be bled," said Dr. Hilton, with the wise roll of the eye he always
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,gave when he talked of diseases.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Nobody answered, for the doctor had said the same thing fifty times
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,before.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Still little Willy kept on rocking and dreaming, as unconscious as a
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,yellow lily swinging on its stem.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Everybody had a story to tell, which everybody else laughed at, while
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,the fire joined in the uproar right merrily. Still Willy slept on.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Presently a glare of light at the windows startled the company.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Must be a fire somewhere!" said one of the men.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Only the moon rising," said another.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"That's no place to look for the moon," said Mr. Parlin, seizing his hat
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,and cloak.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Fire! Fire!" shouted Mr. Riggs, running to the door in a panic.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"I'll warrant it's nothing but a chimney burning out," remarked Caleb,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,coolly; and when all the rest had gone to learn what it meant, he chose
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,to stay behind.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,There was nobody left in the bar-room now but himself and the sleeping
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Willy.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Guess I'll take a look at the drawer, and see that the money is all
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,right," said careful Caleb, stepping inside the bar, which had a long
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,wooden grate, and looked somewhat like an enormous bird-cage, with the
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,roof off. "Mr. Parlin is a very careless man," said Caleb, drawing a
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,key from its hiding-place in an account-book; "he's dreadful free and
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,easy about money. I don't know what he'd do without me to look out for
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,him."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,So saying, Caleb turned the key in the lock, and opened the drawer.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,There were rolls of bank bills lying in it, and handfuls of gold and
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,silver.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"With so many coming and going in this house, it's a wonder Mr. Parlin
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,ain't robbed every night of his life," said Caleb, reckoning over the
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,bills very fast, for he was in the habit of counting money.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Was it all right? Was the ox money there? When the "man from the
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,west'ard" paid it to Mr. Parlin, Caleb saw Mr. Parlin spread it between
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,the leaves of a little singing-book and lay it in the drawer. Did Caleb
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,find it there now? And if he did, did he _leave_ it there?
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Little boys, what do you suppose? You see he had been cheated out of
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,ninety dollars, and was very angry about it; and now he had the best
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,chance in the world to help himself to another ninety dollars, and make
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,up his loss. Do you think he would do it? Mr. Parlin _was_ very careless
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,about money; quite likely he would never miss this. Was that what Caleb
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,was thinking about, as he knit his brows so hard?
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,True, Caleb professed to fear God, but perhaps he did not fear Him;
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,perhaps he had been living a lie all this time--who knows?
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,After he had staid inside the bar a little while, he came out, and
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,looking carefully at Willy, to make sure he was still asleep, stole out
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,doors and joined the teamsters. They had only reached the top of the
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,hill, and hardly any one had noticed that Caleb had not been with them
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,all the while. The fire was only Mr. Chase's chimney burning out; but it
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,was so late by this time that the men did not go back to Mr. Parlin's
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,bar-room.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Next morning Caleb went over to Cross Lots to see about selling a load
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,of potatoes, and soon after he left there was a great excitement in the
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,house. Mr. Parlin had found, on going to his money-drawer, that he had
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,lost ninety dollars.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Strange!" said he; "I remember it was there all safe at six o'clock;
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,for I saw it with my own eyes. It was spread in an old singing-book; and
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,the singing-book is gone too."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Could anybody have taken it?" said Love. "Who was here last night?"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"O, I never leave a man alone in the bar-room," replied her father; "at
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,any rate I didn't last night."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Caleb would attend to that," said Mrs. Parlin; "he is more particular
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,than you are, I think."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Willy looked up, with his black eyes full of questions.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Was it that money you had for the oxen, papa? Caleb telled me all about
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,it last night. He said you ought to not keep it; you ought to give it to
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,him; he wanted it."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Mr. Parlin shook his head at Willy. "You mustn't make up such stories as
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,that, my son."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"I guess he dreamed it," said sister Love.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"O, I didn't, I didn't; Caleb said so," cried Willy; "he said so last
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,night."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Caleb was gone an unusually long time; and when Dr. Hilton returned from
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Harlow he said he left him at the bank in that town depositing some
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,money.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,That seemed strange, for Caleb had been so unfortunate that no one
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,supposed he had any money to put in the bank.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"If it was anybody but Caleb, I should almost suspect he took that
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,ninety dollars," said Seth, after a while.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Don't--don't think it," exclaimed his mother; "we know Caleb too well
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,for that."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"O, no, no, no!" cried little Willy. "Caleb is going to give me some
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,rabbits. Caleb carries me pickaback; do you s'pose he'd steal?"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,They all laughed at that; it was a little boy's reasoning.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,When Caleb came home that night, and was asked why he had been gone so
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,long, he blushed, and, as Seth thought, looked guilty. He did not say he
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,had put any money in the bank, and did not even mention having been at
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Harlow at all. Nobody could think why he should make such a secret of
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,going to Harlow, for Caleb was a great talker, and usually told all his
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,affairs to everybody.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Father has lost ninety dollars, Caleb," said Seth, looking him straight
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,in the eye; "who do you suppose has got it?"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Where? When?" cried Caleb; and then, when he had heard the story, he
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,turned quite pale, and declared he was "'palled." When Caleb was greatly
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,amazed, he said he was "'palled."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,It was very uncomfortable at Mr. Parlin's for a few days. Nobody liked
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,to believe that Caleb had taken the money, but it did really seem very
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,much like it. Mrs. Parlin said she could not and would not believe it,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,and she even shed tears when she saw her husband and sons treat Caleb so
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,coldly.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Poor Caleb! Whether he was guilty or not, he was certainly very unhappy.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Willy," said he, "what made you tell your father I said I wanted his
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,money? I never made such a speech in my life?"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"O, yes, you did, Caleb! Certain true you did! And I a sitting on your
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,knee. But you wouldn't steal, Cale Cushing, and I telled my papa you
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,wouldn't."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Willy," said Caleb, sadly, "I don't think you mean to tell a lie, but
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,what you are talking about I don't know. I never stole so much as a pin
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,in my life; yet all the same I must go away from this place. I can't
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,stay where everybody is pointing the finger at me."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Who pointed a finger at you, Caleb? I didn't see 'em."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Caleb smiled a broken-hearted smile, kissed Willy over and over again,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,and went away that night, no one knew whither. He said to himself,--
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,    "Honor gone, all's gone;
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,    Better never have been born."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Was he guilty? Who could tell? Was he innocent? Then you may be sure God
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,would make it clear some time. Caleb would only have to wait.

little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,CHAPTER III.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,THE TRUNDLE-BED.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,They were all very sorry to have Caleb go away, for he had lived in the
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,family a great many years, and was always good-natured and obliging.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"But since he has turned out to be a thief, of course we don't want him
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,here," said Seth.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"How can you speak so, my son?" said his mother, reprovingly. "You do
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,not really know any harm of Caleb. Remember what the Bible says, 'Judge
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,not, that ye be not judged.'
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Why, mother, who judged Caleb? Who ever accused him of stealing? I
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,should think he judged himself--shouldn't you? When a man runs away as
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,he did, it looks very much as if he was guilty."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"O, no," said gentle Love, who was knitting "double mittens" in the
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,corner; "that isn't a sure sign at all. I dare say he went away because
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,he was unhappy. How would _you_ like to live with people that don't
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,trust you? Why, Seth, you couldn't bear it, I'm sure."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"I wish Caleb didn't go off," said Willy; "he was a-going to give me a
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,rabbit."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Well," said Stephen, in a teasing tone, "he wouldn't have gone off if
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,it hadn't been for you, Master Willy! You said he wanted father's money,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,you know, and that was what put us to thinking."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"O, yes, he telled me he wanted it," cried the little fellow stoutly.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Willy, Willy, you should be more careful in repeating other people's
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,words," said Mrs. Parlin, looking up from the jacket she was making.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Little boys like you are so apt to make mistakes, that they ought to
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,say, 'Perhaps,' or, 'I think so,' and never be too sure."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Then I'm not sure; but _perhaps_ I know, and I _guess_ I think so real
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,hard."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"That's right, little Pawnee Indian," laughed Stephen. "Indians like you
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,always stick fast to an idea when they once get hold of it."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"I'm not an Indian," said Willy, ready to cry; "and I never said Caleb
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,stealed; 'twas you said so; you know you did."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,It grew very cold that winter, about "Christmas-tide," and one night the
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,wind howled and shrieked, while up in the sky the moon and stars seemed
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,to shiver and shine like so many icicles. Willy had been put to bed at
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,the usual time, and nicely tucked in, and it was nearly half past eight,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,the time for him to begin his wanderings. Lydia sat by the kitchen
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,fireplace, comforting herself with hot ginger tea.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"It would be too bad for that little creetur to get out of bed such a
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,night as this," thought she; "I'm going in to see if he has enough
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,clothes on. Who knows but his dear little nose is about _fruz_ off by
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,this time?"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,So she stole into the bedroom, which opened out of the kitchen, took a
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,peep at her beloved Willy, made sure his nose was safe, and turned down
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,the coverlet to see if his hands were warm.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Poor, sweet little lamb! Not much cold now; but thee will be cold;
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,this room is just like a barn."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Then, as "Liddy" went back to the kitchen, she wondered if it might not
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,be the cold weather that made Willy have what she called his
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"walking-spells."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"For he is so much worse in winter than he is in summer," thought she.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Any way, I'm going to try, and see if I can't put a stop to it
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,to-night; and then, if the _expeeriment_ works, I'll try it again."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,What "expeeriment"? You will soon see. There had been a quantity of
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,charcoal put on the kitchen fire to broil some steak for travellers; so
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,the kind-hearted Liddy bustled about on tiptoe, filled a shallow pan
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,with some of the coals, "piping hot," and placed it very near the
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,trundle-bed, on Mrs. Parlin's foot-stove.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Alas for Liddy's ignorance! she was always rather foolish in her
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,fondness for Willy; but didn't she know any better than to put a dish of
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,red coals so near him in a small room, and then go out and shut the
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,door? She often said she didn't "see any use in all this book-larning,"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,and wondered Mrs. Parlin should be so anxious to have her children go to
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,school. In her whole life Liddy had never attended school more than six
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,months; and as for chemistry and philosophy she knew nothing about them
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,except that they are hard words to spell. She did not dream that there
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,was a deadly gas rising every moment from that charcoal, and that her
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,darling Willy was breathing it into his lungs. She may have heard of the
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,word "gas," but if she had she supposed it was some sort of "airy
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,nothing" not worth mentioning.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Of course _you_ know that if she had hated Willy, and wished to murder
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,him, she could hardly have chosen a surer way than this; but poor Liddy
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,went back to the kitchen with a smiling face, feeling well pleased with
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,her "_expeeriment_," and began to chop a hash of beef, pork, and all
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,sorts of vegetables, for to-morrow's breakfast.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,After a little while Willy began to toss about uneasily; but he did not
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,come out of the room and Liddy was delighted. She had said she meant to
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,put a stop to that; and so, indeed, she had,--for this time at least.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,The dear child had not strength enough to get out of bed, and moaned as
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,if a heavy hand were clutching at his throat. In fact he was
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,suffocating. It is frightful to think of! Was nobody coming to save him?
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,The chilly teamsters had some time ago crowded into the bar-room with
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,frost on their hair and whiskers; but the frost was fast turning to
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,steam as they drank the cider which John, the new hired man, heated with
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,the red-hot loggerhead. Dr. Hilton had set out the little red chair, and
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,somebody would have wondered why Willy did not come in, if the men had
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,not all been so busy telling stories that they did not have time to
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,think of anything else.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,It was now nearly nine, and Mrs. Parlin and Love were in the
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,sitting-room sewing by the light of two tallow candles.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Isn't it the coldest night we've had this year, mother?"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Yes, dear, I think it is. You know what the old ditty says,--
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,    'When the days begin to lengthen,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,    The cold begins to strengthen.'
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"I do wish dear little Willy would stay in his bed, nicely 'happed' in'"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,(_happed_ is the Scotch word for "tucked"), "but I suppose he is just as
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,well off by the bar-room fire. It's lucky he doesn't take a fancy to
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,wander anywhere else, and we can always tell where he is."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"But, mother, I haven't heard him pass through the south entry,--have
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,you? I always know when he goes into the bar-room by the quick little
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,click of the latch."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"So do I," replied her mother; "but now I think of it, I haven't heard
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,him to-night. I can't help hoping he is going to lie still."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,There was nothing more said for a little while. They were both very busy
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,finishing off a homespun suit for Willy. How should they suspect that a
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,strange stupor was fast stealing over their little darling? Who was
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,going to tell them that even now he was entering the valley of the
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,shadow of death? _Who?_ I cannot answer that question; I only know that
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,just then Mrs. Parlin, who was going to bed in about fifteen minutes,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,and did not like to leave her work yet, suddenly dropped the jacket,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,which was almost done, and said,--
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Love, I guess I'll go in and look at that child. He may have tossed the
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,clothes off and got a little chilly."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Then she arose from her chair slowly,--she was so large that she always
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,moved slowly,--took one of the candles, and went into the kitchen.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,As she opened the bedroom door--Well, I cannot tell you; you will have
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,to imagine that white, white face, pressed close to the pillow, that
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,limp little figure, stretched under the coverlet, in awful stillness.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"O God, is it too late?" thought Mrs. Parlin. She saw the charcoal; she
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,understood it all in an instant.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Lydia, come quick!"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,A low moan fell on her ear as she bent to listen. Thank Heaven, it was
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,not too late! Willy could yet be saved!
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Happy mother, receiving her precious one as if from the dead! Bewildered
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Willy, coming back to life with no remembrance of the dark river which
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,he had almost forded, without a thought of the pearly gates he had
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,almost entered!
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Conscience-stricken "Liddy!" How she suffered when she found what she
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,had done! Not that she made a scene by screaming and tearing her hair,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,as some ignorant people are apt to do at such a time. No; Liddy was a
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Quaker, and the Quaker blood is very quiet. She only pressed her hands
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,together hard, and said to Mrs. Parlin,--
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Thee knows I never _meant_ any harm to that sweet child."

little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,THE OX-MONEY.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Perhaps the shock had some effect upon Willy's habits, for after this he
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,did not walk in his sleep for some time.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,But one night, as the teamsters were drinking their cider, and talking
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,about the well-beloved "Kellup," wondering why he should take it into
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,his head to steal,--"as honest a man, they had always thought, as ever
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,trod shoe-leather,"--the bar-room door softly opened, and in glided
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Willy, in his flannel night-dress.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,The men were really glad to see him, and nodded at one another, smiling,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,but, as usual, made no remark about the child. They knew he could not
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,hear, but it seemed as if he could, and they were a little careful what
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,they said before him.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Yes," said Mr. Parlin, going on to speak of Caleb, "I considered him an
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,honest, God-fearing man, and trusted him as I would one of my own sons.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,If there was any other way to account for that money, I should be glad,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,I assure you,--as glad as any of you."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Where has Kellup gone to?" asked Mr. Griggs.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Gone to Bangor, they say."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,All this while Willy had not seated himself in his little chair, but was
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,walking towards the bar. After muttering to himself a little while, he
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,went in and took from the shelf the old account-book. Mr. Parlin looked
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,at the teamsters, and put his finger on his lips as a hint for them to
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,keep still, and see what the child would do.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Willy felt in the account-book for the key, then glided along to the
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,money-drawer and opened it.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"There, now, it isn't here," said he, after he had fumbled about for a
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,while with his chubby fingers; "the book isn't here that had the
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,ox-money in it. Caleb mustn't have that money; it belongs to my father."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,The men grew very much interested, and began to creep up a little
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,nearer, in order to catch every word.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Money all gone," sighed Willy; and then, appearing to think for a
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,moment, added, "O, yes; but I know where I put it!"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Breathless with surprise, Mr. Parlin and his guests watched the child as
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,he pattered with bare feet across the floor to the west side of the
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,room, climbed upon a high stool, and opening the "vial cupboard," took
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,out from a chink in the wall, behind the bottles, a little old
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,singing-book.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,It was only the danger of startling Willy too suddenly that prevented
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,the amazed father from snatching the book out of his hand.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Yes, the ox-money is here," said Willy, patting the notes, which lay
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,between the leaves.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,How _do_ you suppose he could see them, with his eyes fixed and vacant?
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Then he seemed to be considering for a space what to do; but at last put
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,the singing-book back again in the chink behind the bottles, clambered
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,down from the stool, and taking his favorite seat in the red chair,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,began to warm his little cold feet before the fire.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Well, that beats all!" exclaimed Dr. Hilton, before any one else could
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,get breath to speak.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Mr. Parlin went at once to the cupboard, and took down the singing-book.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"The money is safe and sound," said he, as he looked it over,--"safe and
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,sound; and Caleb Cushing is an honest man, thank the Lord!"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Three cheers for Caleb!" said Dr. Hilton.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Three cheers for Kellup!" cried one of the teamsters.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,And quite forgetting the sleeping child, the rest of the teamsters took
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,up the toast, and shouted,--
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Three cheers for Kellup Cushing! Hoo-ra-a-ay!"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Of course that waked Willy, and frightened him dreadfully. Imagine
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,yourself going to sleep in bed, and waking up in a chair in another
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,room, in a great noise. It was the first time the little fellow had ever
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,been roused from one of his "walking-spells," and they had to carry him
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,away to his mother to be comforted.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,He did not know that night what had happened; but next morning they told
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,him that Caleb did not steal the money, and that papa had written a
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,letter to beg him to come back.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"And how think we found out that Caleb didn't steal?" asked Stephen.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Of course Willy had not the least idea.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Because you stole the money yourself!" replied the hectoring Stephen.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"O, what a story!" exclaimed Willy, angrily. "'S if _I'd_ steal!"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Ah, but you did, little man! I'll leave it to father if you didn't!"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Willy stamped and kicked. He had a high temper when it was aroused, and
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,his sister Love had to come and quiet him.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"You took the money in your sleep," said she. "You didn't mean to do it;
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,you are not a thief, dear; and we love you just as well as we did
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,before."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,They all thought Willy must have had a dream about Caleb and the
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,ox-money, or he would never have gone and taken the singing-book out of
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,the drawer; but from that day to this he has never been able to
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,remember the dream.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Caleb cried for joy when he received the letter, and fell on his
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,knees,--so he afterwards told grandpa Cheever,--and thanked his heavenly
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Father for bringing him out of the greatest trial he had ever had in his
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,life. He was very glad to go back to Mr. Parlin's, and everybody there
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,received him like a prince. King George the Third, coming in his own
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,ship from England, would not have been treated half so well; for the
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Parlins despised him,--poor crazy monarch,--whereas they now thought
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Caleb was the very pink of perfection. Even Seth begged pardon for his
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,hasty judgment. Mrs. Parlin gave him "election cake," for supper, and
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,some of her very best ginger preserves, and said she did not see how
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,they could make up for the pain of mind he had suffered.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Caleb confessed that he _had_ felt "kind o' bad; but it wasn't worth
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,speaking of now."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,After this, when Willy told any improbable story, and insisted that it
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,was true, as children often will, his mother had only to remark,--
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Remember Caleb! You said he wanted your father's money. Is this story
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,any more reasonable than that?" and Willy would blush, and stammer
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,out,--
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Well, _perhaps_ it isn't true, mamma. I won't tell it for certain; but
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,I _think_ so, you know!"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,       *       *       *       *       *
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,I believe this was the only time that Willy ever did anything in his
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,sleep that is worth recording. The rest of his adventures occurred when
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,he was wide awake; so, you see, if he did wrong there was not so much
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,excuse for him.

little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,THE BOY THAT WORE HOME THE MEDAL.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,The school-house was deep red, and shamed the Boston pinks, which could
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,not blush to the least advantage near it. It stood on a sand-bank, with
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,a rich crop of thistles on three sides, and an oak tree in one corner.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,There were plenty of beautiful places in town; but the people of
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Perseverance, District Number Three, had chosen this spot for their
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,school-house, because it was not good for anything else.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,It was the middle of September, but the summer term was still in
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,session, because school had not begun that year until after haying. It
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,was Saturday noon, and the fourth class was spelling. The children were
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,all toeing a chalk-mark in the floor, but Willy Parlin scowled and moved
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,about uneasily.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Order there," said Miss Judkins, pounding the desk with her ruler.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"What makes you throw your head back so, William Parlin?"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"'Cause there's somebody trying to tell me the word, and I don't want
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,anybody to tell me," answered Willy, with another toss of his dark
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,locks.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Fred Chase was sitting on a bench behind the class, with an open
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,spelling-book before him, and was the "somebody" who had been whispering
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,the word to Willy; but Willy was naturally as open as the day, and
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,despised anything sly. More than that, he knew his lesson perfectly.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Miss Judkins asked no more questions, for she was well aware that Fred
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Chase was constantly doing just such things. She smiled as she looked at
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Willy's noble face, and was well pleased soon after to hear him spell a
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,word which had been missed by three boys above him, and march straight
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,up to the head. She always liked to have Willy "Captain," for deep down
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,in her heart he was her favorite scholar. There were only a few more
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,words to be spelled; then Willy called out "Captain," the next boy said
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Number One," the third "Number Two," and so on down the whole twenty;
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,and after that the school was dismissed for the week.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,The "mistress" put on her blue gingham "calash,"--a big drawn bonnet
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,shaped like a chaise-top,--and as she was leaving the house she
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,whispered to Willy, "Don't forget what I told you to say to your
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,mother."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"No, marm; you told me to say you'd asked Mrs. Lyman _if it was so_, and
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Mrs. Lyman said, '_Yes, it is too true._'"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"That is it, exactly, dear," replied Miss Judkins, smiling. "And be sure
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,you don't lose your medal."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,She said that just for fun, and it was such a capital joke that Willy's
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,eyes twinkled. Lose the quarter of a dollar dangling from his neck by a
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,red string!--the medal which told as plainly as words can speak, that he
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,had left off that day at the head of his class!
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,As it was Saturday, he was to keep the medal till Monday morning--a
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,great privilege, and one he had enjoyed two or three times before. But
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,there was this drawback; he had to slip the medal under his jacket, out
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,of sight, on Sunday. It was the more to be regretted, as he sat in one
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,of the "amen pews," not far from the pulpit; and if the medal might only
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,hang outside his jacket, where it ought, Elder Lovejoy would certainly
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,catch sight of it when he turned round, and looked through his
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,spectacles, saying, "And now, seventhly, my dear hearers."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Willy would sit, to-morrow, swelling with secret pride, and wishing
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Elder Lovejoy's eyes were sharp enough to pierce through his jacket. But
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,then, as he told his mother, he "liked the feeling of the medal, even
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,if it _was_ covered up." I suppose there was some satisfaction in
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,knowing he was more of a boy than people took him to be.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Wonder what it is that Mrs. Lyman says is too true," thought Willy,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,taking a piece of chalk out of his pocket, and drawing a profile of Miss
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Judkins on the door-sill, while that young lady tripped along the road,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,brushing the golden-rod and sweet-fern with the skirt of her dress.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Now stop that, Gid Noonin," said he, as a large boy came up behind him,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,and tickled him under the arms. "Stop that!" repeated he, making chalk
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,figures, as he spoke, in the ample nose of Miss Judkins.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"7ber 18001," scrawled he, slowly and carefully. "7ber" was short for
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,September; and Gideon could find no fault with that, for people often
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,wrote it so; but he could not help laughing at the extra cipher in the
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,year 1801.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Give me that chalk," chuckled he; and then he wrote, in bold
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,characters, "7ber the 15th, 1801."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Willy dropped his head. He had not learned to write; but did he want to
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,be taught by that great Gid Noonin, the stupidest boy in school? Why, he
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,had gone above Gid long ago, just by spelling "exact." Gideon spelt it
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,e, g, z! Did you ever hear of anything so silly? And he a fellow twelve
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,years old! Willy was just eight, but he hoped he could spell! If you
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,doubted it, there was the medal!
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Gideon was not only a poor scholar,--he was regarded as a bad boy, and
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,many mothers warned their little sons not to play with him.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Look here, Billy, what you up to this afternoon? Going anywhere?"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Only up to the store, I guess. Why?"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"O, nothing partic'lar. Just asked for fun."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Well, give back that piece of chalk," said Willy, "for it isn't mine.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Steve keeps it in his pocket to rub his shoe-buckles with."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Gideon laughed, but would not return the chalk till he had whitened
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Willy's jacket with it and the top of his hat. He never seemed to mean
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,any harm, but just to be running over with good-natured, silly mischief.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Willy ran home whistling; but when he saw his father standing in the
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,front entry, his tune grew a little slower, and then stopped. Mr. Parlin
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,was rather stern with his children, and did not like to have them make
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,much noise in the house.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Well, my son, so you have brought home the medal again. That's
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,right,--that's right."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Willy took off his hat when his father spoke to him, and answered, "Yes,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,sir," with a respectful bow.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,There were two or three men standing in the doorway which led into the
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,bar-room.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"How d'ye do, my fine little lad?" said one of the men; "and what is
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,your name?"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Now, this was a question which Deacon Turner had asked over and over
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,again, and Willy was rather tired of answering it. He thought the deacon
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,might remember after being told so many times.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"My name is just the same as it was the other day when you asked me,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,sir," said he.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,This pert speech called forth a laugh from all but Mr. Parlin, who
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,frowned at the child, and exclaimed,--
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"You are an ill-mannered little boy, sir. Go to your mother, and don't
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,let me see you here again till you can come back with a civil tongue in
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,your head."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Tears sprang to Willy's eyes. He really had not intended any rudeness,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,and was ashamed of being reproved before strangers. He walked off quite
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,stiffly, wishing he was "a growed-up man, so there wouldn't anybody dare
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,send him out to his mother."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,But when he reached the kitchen, he found it so attractive there that he
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,soon forgot his disgrace. A roast of beef was sizzling before the fire
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,on a string, and Siller Noonin was taking a steaming plum pudding out of
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,the Dutch oven, while Mrs. Parlin stood near the "broad dresser," as it
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,was called, cutting bread.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"O, mother, mother! the mistress told me to tell you she asked Mrs.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Lyman what you asked her to, and she told _her_ to ask _me_ to tell
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,_you_ it was too true.--Now, _what_ is too true, mother?"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"It is too true that you are right in my way, you dear little plague,"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,said Mrs. Parlin, stopping, in the very act of cutting bread, to hug the
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,rosy-cheeked boy. She was a "business woman," and had many cares on her
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,mind, but always found time to kiss and pet her children more than most
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,people did, and much more than Siller Noonin thought was really
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,necessary.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"But, then," as Siller said, "their father never makes anything of them
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,at all; so I suppose their mother feels obliged to do more than her part
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,of the kissing."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Mother, mother! what is it that is too true? How can anything be too
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,true?" asked Willy, dancing across the hearth, and almost upsetting the
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,dripping-pan in which Liddy had just made the gravy.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"You shall hear, by and by, all it is best for you to know," replied
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Mrs. Parlin. And after dinner was served, and Siller had gone home, she
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,told him that Siller's nephew, Gideon Noonin, had been a very naughty
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,boy--worse than people generally supposed him to be.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,She did not like to repeat the whole of the sad story,--how he had
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,stolen money from Mr. Griggs, the toll-gatherer, and how poor Mr.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Noonin, the father, had paid it back by selling some sheep, and begged
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Mr. Griggs not to send his bad son to jail. She did not wish Willy to
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,know all this; but she told him she was more than ever convinced that
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Gideon was a wicked boy.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"I don't know what makes you little children all like him so well," said
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,she. "He may be funny and good-natured, but he is not a suitable
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,playmate for anybody, especially for a small boy like you. Remember the
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,old proverb, 'Eggs should not dance with stones.'"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Willy looked deeply interested while his mother was talking, and said he
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,would never speak to Gideon except to answer questions.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"But he does ask so many questions! I tell you, mamma, he's always
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,taking hold of you, and asking if you don't want to go somewhere, or do
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,something. And then he makes you go right along and do it, 'cause he's
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,so big. Why he's twice as big as me, mother; but he can't spell worth a
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,cent."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,A little while after this, Willy ran off, whistling, to buy some
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,mackerel and codfish at Daddy Wiggins's store. Before he reached the
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,store, he heard a voice up in the air calling out to him,--
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Hullo, Billy Button! what you crying about down there?"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Willy stopped whistling, and looked up to see where the voice came from.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Gideon Noonin was sitting on the bough of a great maple tree, eating
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,gingerbread. The sight of his face filled Willy with strange feelings.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,What a naughty, dreadful face it was, with the purple scar across the
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,left cheek! Willy had never admired that scar, but now he thought it was
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,horrible. His mother was right: Gid must be a very bad boy.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,At the same time Gid's eyes danced in the most enticing manner, and
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,laughing gleefully he threw down a great ragged piece of gingerbread,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,which Willy knew, from past experience, must be remarkably nice. It was
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,glazed on the top as smooth as satin, and had caraway seeds in it, and
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,another kind of spice of an unknown name. Willy intended to obey his
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,mother, and beware of Gideon; but who had ever told him to beware of
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Gideon's gingerbread? Gid might be bad, but surely the gingerbread
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,wasn't! Moreover, if nobody ate it, it would get stepped on in the road,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,and wasted. So to save it Willy opened his mouth and began to nibble. No
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,harm in that--was there?
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Wan't to go swimming, Billy?"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Willy was walking along as fast as he could, but of course he must
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,answer a civil question.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"No. Don't know how to swim."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Who s'posed you did--a little fellow like you?" said Gid, in a
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,warm-hearted tone, as he dropped nimbly down from the tree, and alighted
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,on his head. "Come 'long o' me, and I'll show you how."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Willy's eyes sparkled,--he didn't know it, but they did,--and he drew in
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,his breath with a "Whew!" Not that he had the least idea of going with
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Gid; but the very thought of it was perfectly bewitching. How often he
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,had teased his two brothers to teach him to swim! and they wouldn't. He
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,was always too young, and they never could stop. They thought he was a
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,baby; but Gid didn't think so. Ah, Gid knew better than that.

little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,CHAPTER VI.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,THE BOY THAT MEANT TO MIND HIS MOTHER.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Come on, Billy Button."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"O, Gid Noonin, I can't."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Why not? Got the cramp?"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Look here, Gid."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Well, I'm looking."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Now, Gid Noonin!"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Yes; that's my name!"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"I shan't go a step!"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"So I wouldn't," returned Gid, coolly. "I only asked you for fun."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"O--h! H'm! Are you going to swim in the brook or the river?"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Brook, you goosie. Prime place down there by the old willow tree.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Don't you wish I'd let you go?"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"No; for my mother says--"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"O, _does_ she, though?"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"My mother says--"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Lor, now, Billy Button!"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Hush, Gid; my mother says--"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"A pretty talking woman your mother is!" struck in Gid, squinting his
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,eyes.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,What a witty creature Gid was! Willy could hardly keep from laughing.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Can't you let me speak, Gid Noonin? My mother says she won't--"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Says she _won't_? That's real wicked kind of talk! I'm ashamed of your
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,mother!"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Willy laughed. Gid did have _such_ a way of making up faces!
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Come on, you little girl-baby! Guess I _will_ take you, if you won't
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,cry."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Willy laughed again. It was not at all painful, but extremely funny, to
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,hear Gid call names, for he never did it in a provoking way at all.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Come along, you little tip end of a top o' my thumb."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"No, _sir_. Shan't go a step!"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Willy was a boy that meant to mind his mother.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"But I s'pose you'll have to go if I take you."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Willy caught himself by the left ear. He felt the need of holding on by
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,something; still he was somehow afraid he should have to go in spite of
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,his ears. Was there ever such a boy as Gid for teasing?
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Why, Gid Noonin, I told you my mother said--"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"No, you didn't! You haven't told me a thing! You stutter so I can't
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,understand a word."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,At the idea of his stuttering, Willy laughed outright; and during that
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,moment of weakness was picked up and set astride of Gid's shoulders.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"You put me down! My mother says I shan't play with you; so there!"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,cried Willy, struggling manfully, yet a little pleased, I must confess,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,to think he couldn't possibly help himself.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Ride away, ride away. Billy shall ride," sang Gid, bouncing his burden
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,up and down.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Willy felt like a dry leaf in an eddy, which is whirled round and round,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,yet is all the while making faster and faster for the hungry dimple in
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,the middle, where there is no getting out again.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"O, dear, Gid's such a great big boy, and I'm _only_ just eight,"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,thought he, jolting up and down like a bag of meal on horseback. Well,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,it would be good fun, after all, to go in swimming,--splendid fun, when
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,there was somebody to hold you up, and keep you from drowning. If you
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,could forget that your mother had told you not to play with Gid Noonin!
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"If you get the string of that medal wet you'll catch it," said Gid.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Better take it off and put it in your pocket."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Just a-going to," said Willy. "D'you think I's a fool?"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Well, wasn't it nice! The water feeling so ticklish all over you, and--
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Why, no, it wasn't nice at all; it was just frightful! After two or
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,three dives, Gid had snapped his fingers in his face, and gone off and
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,left him. Willy couldn't swim any more than a fish-hook. Where _was_
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Gid?
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"The water's up to my chin. Come, Gid, quick!"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,What would Seth and Stephen say if they knew how he was abused? No--his
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,mother? No--Love, and Caleb, and Liddy? How they would feel! There
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,wasn't any bottom to this brook, or if there ever had been it had
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,dropped out.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"O, Gid, I can't stand up."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Gid was in plain sight now, on the bank, pretending to skip stones. Gid
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,was like a Chinese juggler; he could make believe do one thing, while he
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,was really doing another.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Quick! Quick! Quick! I shall dro--ow--own!"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Gid took his own time; but as he swam slowly back to his trembling
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,little playmate, he was "rolling a sweet morsel under his tongue," which
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,tasted very much like a silver medal--with the string taken out.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"What d'you go off for?" gasped Willy.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"For fun, you outrageous little ninny!" mumbled Gid, tickling Willy
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,under the arms. "I'm going to get you out, now, and dress you, and send
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,you home to your mother."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Dress me, I guess!"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Well, you'd better scamper!" said Gid, hurriedly, as they got into
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,their clothes. "Your mother'll have a fit about you."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"My mother? No, she won't. She don't spect the codfish and mackerel till
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,most supper-time. She said I might play, but she wasn't willing I should
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,play with you, though, Gid Noonin," said little Willy, squeezing the
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,water out of his hair.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"But you did, you little scamp! Now run along home. I can't stop to
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,talk. Got to saw wood."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Then what made you creep so awful slow when I called to you?" asked
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Willy, indignantly.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"O, because I've got such a sore throat," wheezed Gideon. "Off with you!
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Scamper!"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Upon that Gid took to his heels, and left Master Willy staring at him,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,and wondering what a sore throat had to do with swimming, and what made
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Gid in such a hurry all in a minute.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"He's a queer fellow--Gid is! Can't spell worth a cent. Should think
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,he'd be ashamed to see a little boy like me wear the medal. Glad I
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,didn't wet it, for the color would have washed out of the string."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,With that Willy put his hand in his pocket.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Out here and show yourself, sir."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,This to the medal.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"What! Why, what's this?"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,He felt in the other pocket.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Why! Why!"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,He drew out junks of blue clay, wads of twine, a piece of chalk, a
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,fish-hook, and various other articles more or less wound up in a wad;
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,but no medal.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Guess there's a hole in my pocket, and the medal fell through."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,And without stopping to examine the pocket, he ran back all the way to
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,the brook. Nowhere to be found. Not in the grass on either side of the
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,road; not on the bank.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Then he remembered to look at his pockets; turned them all three inside
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,out four times. No hole there.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Well, I never!--Look here, you Oze Wiggins; did you pick up anything in
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,the grass?"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Noffin' but a toadstool," replied little Ozem, innocently; and Willy
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,wondered if he wasn't a half-fool to make such an answer as that.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Where can that medal be?" said he, with a dry sob.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,He did not once suspect that Gideon Noonin had taken it.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"I'll go home and tell my mother. O, dear! O, dear!"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,He was still at the tender age when little boys believe their mammas can
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,help them out of any kind of trouble. True, he had been naughty and
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,disobedient; but if he said he was sorry, wouldn't her arms open to take
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,him in? He was sorry now,--no doubt of that,--and was running home with
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,all speed, when the sight of his father in the distance reminded him of
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,his errand, and he rushed back to the store for the codfish and
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,mackerel.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"What makes your hair so wet, bubby?" asked Daddy Wiggins, rolling the
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,fish in brown paper. "Haven't been in swimming--have you?"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Don' know," stammered Willy, darting out of the store.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,If his hair was wet it wouldn't do to go home till it was dry; for his
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,father would find out that he had been in the brook, and the next thing
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,in order would be a whipping. It was hard enough to lose the medal;
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Willy thought a whipping would be more than he could bear, for it was
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,always given with a horsewhip out in the barn; and the unlucky boy could
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,never help envying the cows, as they looked on, chewing their cuds with
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,such an air of content and unconcern. Cows never were punished, nor
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,sheep either. Good times they had--that's a fact. _Sheep_ wouldn't mind
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,a real heavy horse-whipping, they were done up so in wool; but when a
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,little boy had to take off his jacket, why, there wasn't much over his
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,skin to keep off the smart. Ugh! how it did hurt!
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,There was another advantage in being a sheep, or a cow, or a hen;
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,animals of that sort never lost anything--didn't have medals to lose.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"And this wasn't mine," groaned Willy. "What'll the mistress do to me?
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Don' know; blister both hands, I s'pose!"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Willy had intended to play ball with the little boys, but it was not to
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,be thought of now. Putting his fish behind a tree, he ran to the brook
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,again and poked with a stick as far as he could reach; then waded in up
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,to his knees, for the medal might have rolled out of his pocket.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"No, it couldn't; for my breeches were tucked in up there between two
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,rocks."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Suddenly he recollected Gideon's going back to the bank.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"That wicked, mean boy!" almost screamed Willy. "He stole my medal! I'll
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,go right off and tell mother!"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Mrs. Parlin had on her afternoon cap, and was sitting alone in the
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,well-sanded "fore-room," doing the mending, and singing,--
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,    "While shepherds watched their flocks by night,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,      All seated on the ground,"--
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,when Willy, with his pantaloons tucked up to his knees, and his head
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,dripping with water, rushed wildly into the room.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"My medal's gone! Gid Noonin stole it!"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"My son! What do you mean?"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Yes, ma'am; Gid Noonin stole it! Made me go in swimming, and then he
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,stole it!"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Gideon Noonin?" said Mrs. Parlin, with a meaning glance. "That boy?
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,_Made_ you go swimming, my son?"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Willy hung his head.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Yes, ma'am! Marched me off down to the brook pickaback,--he did!"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Poor, little baby!" said Mrs. Parlin, in the soft, pitiful tone she
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,would have used to an infant. "Poor little baby!"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Willy's head sank lower yet, and the blush of shame crept into his
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,cheeks.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Why, mother, he's as strong's a moose; he could most lift _you_!"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"'My son, if sinners entice thee, consent thou not.'"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Well, but I--"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"You consented in your heart, Willy, or Gideon could not have made you
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,go swimming."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,What a very bright woman! Willy was amazed. How could she guess that
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,while riding on Gid's back he had been a _little_ glad to think he could
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,not help it? He had hardly known himself that he was glad, it was such a
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,wee speck of a feeling, and so covered up with other feelings.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"But I tried not to go, mother. I tell you I squirmed awf'ly!"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Well, you didn't try hard enough in the first place, Willy. Come here,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,and sit in my lap, and let us talk it over.--Do you know, my son, if you
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,_had_ tried hard enough, the Lord would have helped you?"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Willy raised his eyes wonderingly. Had God been looking on all the
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,while, just ready to be spoken to? He had not thought of that.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"O, mamma," said he solemnly, "I will mind, next time, see 'f I don't.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,But there's that medal; why, what'll I do?"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"If Gideon will not return it, you must pay Miss Judkins a quarter of a
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,dollar."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"With a hole in," sighed Willy. "Why, I've only got two cents in this
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,world."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"O, well," said Mrs. Parlin, hopefully, "perhaps you can hire out to
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,papa, and earn the rest."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"O, if he'll _only_ let me! Won't you please ask him, mamma?" cried
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Willy, filled with a new hope. "Ask him, and get Love to ask him, too.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,_I_ shouldn't dare do it, you know."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,

little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,CHAPTER VII
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,THE BOY THAT CHEATED.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,The next Monday Seth happened to go into the shed-chamber for a piece of
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,leather to mend an old harness, and met Willy coming down the stairs
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,with a basket full of old iron.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Stop a minute, Willy. What have you got there?"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Willy would have obeyed at once, if it had not been for that lordly tone
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,and air of Seth's, which always made him feel contrary.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Stop, I say!" repeated Seth. "What have you got there?"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Old iron."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Old iron? Did mother send you after it?"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"No."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Well, then, go carry it right back."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Willy did not stir.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Old iron is worth money, little boy."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Yes; I know that."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"And what business have you with it?"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Going to sell it."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"What? Without asking mother, you naughty boy?"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Willy set the heavy basket on the next lower stair.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"So you went up stairs for that iron without leave? What a wicked boy!"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Willy set the basket on another stair.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Bellows' nose, old tea-kettle, rusty nails," said Seth, examining the
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,basket.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Willy Parlin, do you know this is stealing."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"'Tisn't, neither!"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"But I tell you it is! Just as much stealing as if you took money out of
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,father's wallet."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"I don't steal," said Willy, setting the basket on another stair.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Seth was growing exasperated.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"If you don't intend to mind me, Willy Parlin, and carry back that iron,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,I shall have to go and tell father."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Then you'll be a tell-tale, Mr. Seth."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Do you think I'll have my little brother grow up a thief?"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"I wasn't a thief; but you're a tell-tale. You said, yesterday, little
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,boys mustn't tattle, and I guess big boys mustn't tattle, neither,"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,chuckled the aggravating Willy, dragging his basket of iron into the
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,kitchen.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Mother," said Seth, as Mrs. Parlin passed through the shed with a pan
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,of sour milk, "there's got to be something done with Willy; he has taken
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,to stealing."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Mrs. Parlin set the pan upon a bench, and sank down on the meat-block,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,too weak to stand.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"I caught him just now, mother, lugging off a great basket full of old
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,iron; and if you don't go right in and stop him, he'll take it up to the
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,store to sell."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Is that all?" exclaimed Mrs. Parlin, drawing a deep breath. "Why, how
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,you frightened me! His father gave him leave to collect what old iron he
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,could find, and sell it to make up for the medal he lost the other day."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Well there, mother, I'm glad to hear it--that's a fact! But why didn't
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,the little rogue tell me? I declare, he deserves a good whipping for
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,imposing upon me so."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"He ought to have told you; but perhaps you spoke harshly to him, my
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,son. You know Willy can't bear that."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"I don't think I was very harsh, mother. You wouldn't have me see the
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,child doing wrong, and not correct him--would you?"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"His father and I are the ones to correct him," replied Mrs. Parlin.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Willy has too many masters and mistresses. Next time you see him doing
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,what you think is wrong, let me know it, but don't scold him!"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Mrs. Parlin had said this before, but it was something Seth never could
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,remember.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Willy sold the iron, returned a bright new quarter to Miss Judkins, and
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,felt happy again, especially as there were ten cents left, which his
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,father kindly allowed him to keep.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Gideon Noonin never confessed his crime, and after this Willy was very
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,careful to keep away from him. But there was another boy, nearer his own
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,age, who had quite as bad an influence over him--Fred Chase. He
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,afterwards became a worthless young man, and made his mother so wretched
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,that Siller Noonin said, "Poor Mrs. Chase, she has everything heart can
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,wish, except a bottle to put her tears in."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Fred was a well-mannered, pretty little fellow, and no one thought ill
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,of him, because he was so sly with his mischief. He did harm to Willy by
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,making him think he had a very hard time. His work was to bring in a
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,bushel basket of chips every morning, and fill the "fore-room"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,wood-box. Of course the "back-log" and "back-stick," and "fore-stick"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,were all too heavy for his little arms, and Caleb attended to those.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Freddy had nothing whatever to do, and pretended to pity Willy.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"They 'pose upon you," said he. "I never'd stand it."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Until Freddy told him he was imposed upon, Willy had never suspected it;
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,but, after that, he saw he had nearly all the work to do, and that Seth
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,and Stephen did not help as much as they might. The more he reflected
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,upon the subject, the more unhappy he grew, and the more he lingered
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,over his wood and chips.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Did you ever hear of the little boy and the two pails of water?" said
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,his mother.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"O, what about him, mamma? Do tell me."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Why, the boy was told to draw two pails of water from the well; but
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,instead of drawing them he sat down and dreaded it, till he pined away,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,and pined away, and finally died."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Willy ran out with his basket, and never asked again to hear the story
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,of the boy and the two pails. But the wood-pile seemed to be lying on
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,top of his heart, crushing him, till he was relieved by a bright idea.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Why not stand some sticks upright in the bottom of the box, and then lay
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,the rest of the wood on top of them? It would look just the same as
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,usual; but _what_ a help!
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,The box was in the entry, and the "fore-room" door shut; he could cheat
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,as well as not.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Now I'll have lots of time to play!"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"What, you here yet, Willy?" said his mother, opening the door. She
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,thought he had been an unusually long while filling the box; and so he
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,had. It was new business, doing it in this way, and it took time.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"I supposed you had gone, darling, for I didn't hear you whistle."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Willy whistled faintly, as he laid on the last stick. How lucky his
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,mother hadn't opened the door sooner!
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"That's a nice big box full, my son. You please your mother this
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,morning. Come here and kiss me."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Willy went, and then Mrs. Parlin, who was a fine singer, and knew a
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,great many ballads, sang, smiling,--
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,    "Ho! why dost thou shiver and shake,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,           Gaffer Gray?
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,    And why doth thy nose look so blue?"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,She often sang that when he came into the house cold, and then he would
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,sing in reply, with a voice almost as sweet as her own,--
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,         "'Tis the weather that's cold,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,         'Tis I'm grown very old,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,    And my doublet is not very new,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,         Well-a-day!"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,But he was not in a musical mood this morning: he felt in a hurry to be
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,off; and giving his mother a hasty kiss, he bounded away without his
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,shingle-covered spelling-book, and had to come back after it.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Foolish Willy! Did he think his mamma would not find out the deep-laid
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,plot, which had cost him so much labor? Children have no idea how bright
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,their parents are! It was a very cold day in December, and as Mrs.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Parlin kept up a roaring fire, she came before noon to the upright
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,sticks standing in the wood-box, as straight as soldiers on a march. She
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,sighed a little, and smiled a little, but said not a word, for she was a
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,wise woman, was Mrs. Parlin.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Well, Willy boy," said she, when he came home from school, and had had
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,his supper of brown bread, baked apples, and milk, "come, let us have a
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,sing."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,There was nothing Willy and his mother enjoyed better than a "sing," she
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,holding him in her lap and rocking him the while. He put his whole soul
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,into the music, miscalling the Scotch words sometimes so charmingly that
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,it was a real delight to hear him. People often stopped at the
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,threshold, I am told, or at the open window in summer, to listen to the
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,clear childish voice in such ballads as,--
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,    "Fy! let us a' to the wedding,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,      For they will be lilting there;
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,    For Jock's to be married to Maggie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,      The lass wi' the gowden hair."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,To-night it was "Colin's Come to Town;" and Willy's tones rang sweet and
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,high,--
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,    "His very step has music in't,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,    As he comes up the stair."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Did you ever hear the beat of that little chap for singing?" said
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Caleb, in the bar-room, to Dr. Hilton and Mr. Griggs.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Since that sad affair of the ox-money Caleb had loved Willy better than
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,ever, though it would be hard to tell why; perhaps because the child had
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,been so glad to see him come back again.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Bless him!" said Love, bringing the brass warming-pan into the
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"fore-room," to fill it with coals at the fireplace. "Why, mother, I
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,never hear the name 'Willy,' but it makes me think of music. It sounds
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,as sweet as if you said 'nightingale.'"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Mrs. Parlin answered by folding the singing-bird closer to her heart.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"And do you know what the word 'Mother' makes me think of?--Of a great
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,large woman, always just ready to hug somebody."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Mrs. Parlin laughed.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Yes, indeed it does. And it doesn't seem as if a small woman is really
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,fit to be called mother. There's Dorcas Lyman: when she says 'Mother' to
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,that little woman, it sounds so queer to me; for Mrs. Lyman isn't big
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,enough, you know."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"_Course_ she isn't; not half big enough," said Willy. "I could 'most
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,lift her with my little finger. But, then, that baby--she's got a real
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,nice baby; wish she'd give Patty to me."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Love smiled, and walked off, with her long-handled warming-pan, to heat
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,a traveller's bed in the icy north chamber.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Willy's heart was full of tenderness for his mother, whom he kept
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,kissing fondly. Now was a good time to speak of the upright, deceitful
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,sticks of wood, perhaps; but Mrs. Parlin did not do it. She began the
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Evening Hymn, and Willy sang with her:--
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,    "Glory to Thee, my God, this night,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,    For all the blessings of the light;
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,    Keep me, O keep me, King of kings,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,    Beneath thine own almighty wings.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,    "Forgive me, Lord, for thy dear Son,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,    The ills which I this day have done,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,    That with the world, myself, and Thee,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,    I, ere I sleep, at peace may be."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Now, Willy," said Mrs. Parlin, pausing, "let us think a while, and try
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,to remember what we have done to-day that is wrong. You think, and I
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,will think, too."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,He looked up, and she knew by the cloud in his eyes that his conscience
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,was troubled.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Well, I'll think. But _you_ haven't done anything wrong, mamma?"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"O, yes, dear; many things."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Well, so've I, too. Want me to tell what?"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Not unless you choose, my child. Only be sure you tell God."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,They were silent a few moments.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"There, that's the _last_ time I'll ever stand the sticks up on end in
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,the wood-box," burst forth Willy.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"I thought so," said his mother, kissing him.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,So she had known about it all the while!
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,But not another word did she say; and they went on with the hymn:--
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,    "Teach me to live, that I may dread
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,    The grave as little as my bed.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,    Teach me to die, that so I may
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,    Triumphing rise at the last day."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,CHAPTER VIII.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"THE NEVER-GIVE-UPS."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,         "Now Christmas is come,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,          Let us beat up the drum,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,    And call our neighbors together;
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,          And when they appear,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,          Let us make them good cheer,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,    As will keep out the wind and the weather."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,This is what the old song says; but it is not the way the people of the
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,new colonies celebrated Christmas. Indeed, they thought it wrong to
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,observe it at all,--because their forefathers had come away from England
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,almost on purpose to get rid of the forms and ceremonies which hindered
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,their worship in the church over there.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,The Parlins, however, saw no harm in celebrating the day of our
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Saviour's birth, and Mrs. Parlin, who was an Episcopalian, always
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,instructed Love and the boys to trim the house with evergreens, and put
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,cedar crosses in the windows.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Willy was glad whenever his grandfather Cheever happened to be visiting
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,them at "Christmas-tide," for then he was sure of a present. Mr. Cheever
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,was an Englishman of the old school, and prayed for King George. He wore
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,what were called "small clothes,"--that is, short breeches, which came
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,only to the knee, and were fastened there with a buckle,--silk
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,stockings, and a fine ruffled shirt. His hair was braided into a long
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,queue behind, which served Willy for a pair of reins, when he went
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,riding on the dear old gentleman's back.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,I am not sure that Mr. Parlin was always glad to see grandpa Cheever,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,for they differed entirely in politics, and that was a worse thing then
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,than it is now, if you can believe it. Mr. Parlin loved George
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Washington, and grandpa said he was "only an upstart." Grandpa loved
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,King George, and Mr. Parlin said he was "only a crazy man."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,But Willy adored his grandfather, especially at holiday times; for
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,besides presents, they were sure to have games in the big dining-room,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,such as blindfold, or "Wood-man blind," bob-apple, and snap-dragon.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Then they always had a log brought in with great ceremony, called the
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Yule log, the largest one that could be found in the shed; and when Seth
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,and Stephen came staggering in with it, grandpa Cheever, and Mrs.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Parlin, and Love, and Willy all struck up,--
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,      "Come, bring with a noise,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,       My merry, merry boys,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,    The Christmas log to the firing,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,       While my good dame, she
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,       Bids ye all be free,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,    And drink to your hearts' desiring."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,The "good dame," I suppose, was Mrs. Parlin; and she gave them to drink,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,it is true, but nothing stronger than metheglin, or egg nog, or flip. It
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,seems to me I can almost see her standing by the table, pouring it out
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,with a gracious smile. She was a handsome, queenly-looking woman, they
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,say, though rather too large round the waist you might think.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Her father was a famous singer, as well as herself; and for my part I
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,should have enjoyed hearing some of their old songs, while the wind
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,went whistling round the house:--
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,    "Without the door let Sorrow lie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,    And if for cold it hap to die,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,    We'll bury it in a Christmas pie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,        And evermore be merry."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Or this one:--
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,    "Rejoice, our Saviour, he was born
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,    On Christmas day in the morning."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,But these were family affairs, these Christmas meetings. No one else in
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Perseverance had anything to do with them, not even Caleb or Lydia.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,But the little boys in those days did not live without amusements, you
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,may be sure. Perhaps their choicest and most bewitching sport was
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,training. There had been one great war,--the war of the
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Revolution,--and as people were looking for another,--which actually
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,came in 1812,--it was thought safe for men to be drilled in the practice
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,of marching and carrying fire-arms.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,In Perseverance, and many other towns, companies were formed, such as
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,the Light Infantry, or "String Bean Company," the Artillery, and the
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Troop." These met pretty often, and marched about the streets to the
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,sound of martial music.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Of course the little boys could not see and hear of all this without a
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,swelling of the heart and a prancing of the feet; for they were rather
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,different from boys of these days! Hard indeed, thought they, if they
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,couldn't form a company too! As for music, what was to hinder them from
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,pounding it out of tin pans and pewter porringers? There is music in
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,everything, if you can only get it out. Chickens' wind-pipes, when well
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,dried, are very melodious, and so are whistles made of willow; and if
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,you are fond of variety, there are always bones to be had, and
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,dinner-horns, and jews-harps.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Full of zeal for their country, the little boys on both sides of the
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,river met together and formed quite a large company. They had two trials
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,to begin with; firstly, they could not think of a name fine enough for
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,themselves; and secondly, they could not get any sort of uniform to
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,wear. Their mothers could not see the necessity of their having new
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,suits just to play in; and it seemed for some time as if the little
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,patriots would have to march forever in their old every-day clothes.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"But they'll give us some new ones by and by, boys," said Willy. "My
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,mother laughed last night, when I asked again, and that's a certain sure
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,sign."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"O, I thought we'd given that up," said Fred Chase.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Look here, boys," exclaimed Willy; "I've thought of a name; it's the
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,'Never-Give-Ups.' All in favor say 'Ay'!"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Ay! ay!" piped all the lads; and it was a vote. Perhaps it was a year
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,before the Never-Give-Ups got their uniforms; but at last their mammas
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,saw the subject in a proper light, and stopped their work long enough to
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,dye some homespun suits dark blue, and trim them gorgeously with red.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Willy's regimentals were not home-made; they were cut down from his
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,father's old ones; and he might have been too well pleased with them,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,only Fred Chase's were better yet, being new, with the first gloss on,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,just as they had come from a store in the city of Boston.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Fred was captain of the company. The boys had felt obliged in the very
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,beginning to have it so, on account of a beautiful instrument, given him
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,by his father, called a flageolet. True, Fred could not play on it at
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,all, and had to give it up to Willy; but it belonged to him all the
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,same.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Something's the matter with my lungs," said Fred, coughing; "and that's
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,why those little holes plague me so; it's too hard work to blow 'em."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,The boys looked at one another with wise nods and smiles. They did not
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,like Fred very well; but he was always pushing himself forward: and when
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,a boy has a great deal of self-esteem, and a brave suit of clothes
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,right from Boston, how are you going to help yourselves, pray? So Fred
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,was captain, and Willy only a fifer.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,There was one boy in the ranks who caused some trouble--Jock Winter. Not
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,that Jock quarrelled, or did anything you could find fault with; but he
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,was simple-minded and a hunchback, and some of the boys made fun of him.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,When Fred became captain he fairly hooted him out of the company. "No
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,fair! no fair!" cried Willy, Joshua Potter, the Lyman twins, and two
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,thirds of the other boys; but the captain had his way in spite of the
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,underground muttering.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Saturday afternoon was the time for training. The Never-Give-Ups met at
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,the old red store kept by Daddy Wiggins, and paraded down the village
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,street, and across the bridge, as far sometimes as the Dug Way, a
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,beautiful spot three or four miles from home. They were a goodly sight
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,to see,--the bright, healthy boys, straight as the "Quaker guns" they
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,carried, and marching off with a firm and manly tread.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Mothers take a secret pride in their sons, and many loving eyes watched
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,this procession out of town; but the procession didn't know it, for the
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,mothers were very much afraid of flattering the boys. I think myself it
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,would have done the little soldiers no harm to be praised once in a
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,while. Indeed, I wish they might have heard the ladies of the village
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,talking about them, as they met to drink tea at Mrs. Parlin's. She never
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,went out herself, but often invited company to what they called little
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"tea-junketings."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Well," said Mrs. Potter, the doctor's wife, "isn't it enough to do your
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,eyes good to see such a noble set of boys?"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Yes, it is," said Mrs. Griggs; "and I am not afraid for our country, if
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,they grow up as good men as they now bid fair to be."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Mrs. Chase could not respond to this, for her boy Fred was a great
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,trial; his father indulged him too much, and she had had strong fears
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,that he might take to bad habits. But he was as handsome as any of the
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,boys, and she spoke up quickly:--
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Yes, Mrs. Potter; as you say, they _are_ a noble-looking set of boys;
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,and don't they march well?"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"They waste a great deal of time; but then they might be doing worse,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,and I like to see boys enjoy themselves," said Mrs. Lyman, the greatest
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,worker in town.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Her twins, George and Silas, ought to have heard that, for they thought
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,their mother did not care to see them do anything but delve.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Ah, bless their little hearts, we are all as proud of them as we can
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,be," said ruddy, fleshy Mrs. Parlin, brushing back her purple
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,cap-strings as she poured the tea. "My Willy, now, is the very apple of
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,my eye, and the little rogue knows it too."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Yes, Willy did know it, for his mother was not afraid to tell him so.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,The other boys had love doled out to them like wedding cake, as if it
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,were too rich and precious for common use; but Mrs. Parlin's love was
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,free and plenteous, and Willy lived on it like daily bread.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Kissing and petting were sure to spoil boys, so Elder Lovejoy's wife
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,thought; and she longed to say so to Mrs. Parlin; but somehow she
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,couldn't; for her little Isaac was not half as good as Willy, though he
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,hadn't been kissed much since he was big enough to go to school.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Willy's grandpa Cheever has sent him a splendid present," said Mrs.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Parlin; "it is a drum. His birthday will come next Wednesday; but when I
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,saw him marching off with Freddy's flageolet under his arm, I really
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,longed to give him the drum to-day."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"I dare say you did," said Mrs. Lyman, warmly. "We mothers enjoy our
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,children's presents more than they enjoy them themselves."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Then she and Mrs. Parlin exchanged a pleasant smile, for they two
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,understood each other remarkably well.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Willy received his drum on the fifteenth of September, his tenth
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,birthday, and was prouder than General Washington at the surrender of
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Lord Cornwallis. No more borrowed flageolets for him. He put so much
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,soul into the drumsticks that the noise was perfectly deafening. He
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,called the family to breakfast, dinner, and supper, to the tune of "Hail
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Columbia," or "Fy! let us a' to the wedding!" and nearly distracted
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Quaker Liddy by making her roll out her pie-crust to the exact time of
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Yankee Doodle."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"I don't see the sense of such a con-tin-oo-al thumping, you little
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,dear," said she.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"That's 'cause you're a Quaker," cried Willy. "But I tell you while my
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,name's Willy Parlin this drum _shall_ be heard."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Poor Liddy stopped her ears.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"What you smiling for, mother?" said Willy. "Are you pleased to think
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,you've got a little boy that can pound music so nice?"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Not exactly that, my son. I was wondering whether there is room enough
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,out of doors for that drum."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Why, mother!" exclaimed the little soldier much chagrined. "Why,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,mother!"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Everybody else had complained of the din; but he thought she, with her
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,fine musical taste, must be delighted. After this pointed slight he did
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,not pound so much in the house, and the animals got more benefit of the
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,noise. Towler enjoyed it hugely; and the cows might have kept step to
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,the pasture every morning, and the hens every night to the roost, if
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,they had had the least ear for music. Siller Noonin, who believed in
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,witches, began to think the boy was "possessed." Love laughed, and said
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,she did not believe that; but she was afraid Willy spoke the truth every
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,day when he said so stoutly,--
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"While my name is Willy Parlin, this drum _shall_ be heard."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,She wondered if parchment would ever wear out.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,He drummed with so much spirit that it had a strong effect on the little
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,training company. They had always liked him much better than Fred, and
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,were glad of an excuse now to make him their captain. A boy who could
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,fife so well, and drum so well, ought to be promoted, they
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,thought--"All in favor say Ay!"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Poor Fred was dismayed. He had always known he was unpopular; still he
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,had not expected this.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"But how can _I_ be captain?" replied Willy, ready to shout with
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,delight. "If I'm captain, who'll beat my drum?"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Isaac Lovejoy," was the quick reply.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,That settled it, and Willy said no more. He was now leader of the
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,company, and Fred Chase was obliged to walk behind him as first
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,lieutenant.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,But the moment Willy was promoted, and before they began to march, he
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"took the stump," and made a stirring speech in favor of Jock Winter.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Now see here, boys," said he, leaning on his wooden gun, and looking
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,around him persuasively. "'All men are born free and equal.' I s'pose
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,you know that? It's put down so in the Declaration of Independence!"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"O, yes! Ay! Ay!"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Well, Jock Winter was born as free and equal as any of us; he wasn't
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,born a hunchback. But see here: wouldn't you be a hunchback yourself,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,s'posing your father had let you fall down stairs when you was a baby? I
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,put it to you--now wouldn't you?"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Ay, ay," responded the boys.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Well; and s'pose folks made fun of you just for that; how would you
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,like it?"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Shouldn't like it at all."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"But then Jock's just about half witted," put in Fred, faintly. He knew
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,his power was gone, but he wanted to say something.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Well, what if he is half-witted? He thinks more of his country than you
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,do; twice more, and risk it."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"That's so," cried Joshua Potter. "Fred says if there's another war,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,_he_ won't go; he never'll stand up for a mark to be shot at, at eleven
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,dollars a month!"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"O, for shame!" exclaimed the captain.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Now you hush up," said Fred, reddening. "I was only in fun--of course I
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,was! You needn't say anything, Will Parlin; a boy that has a _Tory
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,drum_!"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"It's a good Whig drum as ever lived!" returned Willy. "But come, now,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,boys; will we have Jock Winter?"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,It was a vote; and the Never-Give-Ups went over the river in a body to
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,invite him. He lived in a log-house with his grandfather, and a negro
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,servant known as Joe Whitehead. Old Mr. Winter was aroused from his
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,afternoon nap by the terrific beating of the drum, and thought the
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,British were coming down upon him.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Joe! Joe!" cried he. "Get your scythe, Joe, and mow 'em down as fast as
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,they come!"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,When the little boys heard of this, it amused them greatly. Mistaken for
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,the British army, indeed! Well, now, that was something worth while!
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,A happier soul than little, simple, round-shouldered Jock you never saw,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,unless it was his poor old grandfather. He could keep step with the best
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,of them; but unfortunately he had no decent clothes. This was a great
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,drawback, but Mrs. Parlin and Mrs. Lyman took pity on the boy, and made
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,him a nice suit.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,

little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,CHAPTER IX.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,THE MUSTER.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Willy proved to have fine powers as a leader. Like the famous John
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Gilpin,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,    "A train-band captain eke was he,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,       Of credit and renown,"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,and the Never-Give-Ups became such an orderly, well-trained company,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,that some of the rich fathers made them the present of a small cannon.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Do you know what a wonderful change that made in the condition of
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,things? Well, I will tell you. They became at once an Artillery Company!
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Not poor little infantry any more, but great, brave artillery!
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Every man among them cast aside his Quaker gun with contempt, and wore a
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,cut-and-thrust sword, made out of the sharpest kind of wood. An
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Artillery Company,--think of that! The boys threw up their caps, and
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Willy sang,--
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,    "Come, fill up my cup, come, fill up my can;
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,    Come, saddle your horses, and call up your men!
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,    Come, open the west port, and let us gang free,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,    And it's room for the bonnets of Bonny Dundee!"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,There was to be a General Muster that fall, and if you suppose the
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Perseverance boys had thought of anything else since the Fourth of July,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,that shows how little you know about musters.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,A muster, boys--Well, I never saw a muster, myself; but it must have
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,been something like this:--
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,A mixture of guns and gingerbread; men and music; horses and hard
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,cider.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,It was very exciting,--I know that. There were plumes dancing, flags
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,waving, cannons firing, men marching, boys screaming, dogs barking; and
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,women looking on in their Sunday bonnets.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,The "Sharp-shooters" and the "String Beans" were there from Cross Lots;
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,the Artillery from Harlow; the "Pioneers," in calico frocks, with wooden
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,axes, from Camden; and all the infantry and cavalry from the whole
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,country round about.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Seth Parlin belonged to the cavalry, or "troop," and made a fine figure
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,on horseback. Willy secretly wondered if he would look as well when _he_
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,grew up.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,    "Saddled and bridled and booted rode he,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,    A plume at his helmet,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,    A sword at his knee."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,It seemed to be the general impression that the muster would do the
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,country a great deal of good. The little artillery company, called the
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Never-Give-Ups, were on the ground before any one else, their cheeks
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,painted with clear, cold air, and their hearts bursting with patriotism.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,As a rule, children were ordered out of the way; but as the little
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Never-Give-Ups had a cannon, they were allowed to march behind the large
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,companies, provided they would be orderly and make no disturbance.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Boys," said Willy, sternly,--for he felt all the importance of the
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,occasion,--"boys, remember, George Washington was the Father of his
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Country; so you've got to behave."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,The boys remembered "the father of his country" for a while, but before
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,the close of the afternoon forgot him entirely. There were several
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,stalls where refreshments were to be had,--such as cakes, apples,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,molasses taffy, sugar candy, and cider by the mugful, not to mention the
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,liquors, which were quite too fiery for the little Never-Give-Ups.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,At every halt in the march the boys bought something to eat or drink.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,There had been a barrel of cider brought from Mr. Chase's for their
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,especial use, and Fred sold it out to the boys for four cents a glass.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,This was a piece of extraordinary meanness in him, for his father had
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,intended the cider as a present to the company. The boys did not know
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,this, however, and paid their money in perfect good faith.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Hard stuff," said Willy, draining his mug. "I don't like it much."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Why, it's tip-top," returned Fred. "My father says it's the best he
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,ever saw."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Mr. Chase had never said anything of the sort. He had merely ordered his
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,colored servant, Pompey, to put a barrel of cider on the wheelbarrow,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,and take it to the muster-ground. Whether Pompey and Fred had selected
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,this one for its age I cannot tell, but the boys all declared it was "as
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,hard as a stone wall."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Dr. Hilton, who seemed to be everywhere at once, heard them say that,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,and exclaimed,--
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Then I wouldn't drink any more of it, boys. Hard cider does make
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,anybody dreadful cross. Better let it alone."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,I fear the boys did not follow this advice, for certain it is that they
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,grew outrageously cross. The trouble began, I believe, with Abram
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Noonin, who suddenly declared he wouldn't march another step with Jock
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Winter. As the marching was all done for the day, Abram might as well
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,have kept quiet.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Yes, you shall march with Jock Winter, too," said Captain Willy,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,exasperated with the throbbing pain in his head--the first he had ever
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,felt in his life. "Pretty doings, if you are going to set up and say, 'I
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,will' and 'I won't!'"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,While the captain and the private were shooting sharp words back and
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,forth, and Fred was busy drawing cider, Isaac Lovejoy, the rogue of the
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,company, was very busy with his own mischief.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Look here, Fred," said Joshua Potter, going up to the stall with a
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,twinkle in his eye; "they don't ask but three cents a mug, round at the
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,other end of the barrel!"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"What do you mean by that?" cried the young cider merchant, looking up
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,just in time to see Isaac Lovejoy marching off with the pitcher he had
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,been filling from a hole in the barrel made with his jack-knife.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Stop thief! Stop thief!" cried Fred.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"That's right," said one of the big boys from over the river. "Ike's
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,selling your cider to the men for three cents a glass."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Perhaps this was one of Isaac's jokes, and he intended to give back the
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,money; we will hope so. But, be that as it may, Fred was terribly angry;
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,as angry, mind you, as if he was an honest boy himself, and had a
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,perfect right to all the coppers jingling in his own pockets!
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,He ran after Ike, and caught him; and there was a scuffle, in which the
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,pitcher was broken. Mr. Chase came up to inquire into it.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Tut, tut, Isaac!" said he; "aren't you ashamed? You know that cider was
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,a present to the Never-Give-Ups."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,The boys were astonished, and Fred's face crimsoned with shame. As soon
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,as Mr. Chase had gone away, Willy exclaimed, with a sudden burst of
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,wrath,--
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Well, boys, if you are going to stand such a mean lieutenant as that, I
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,won't! If he stays in lieutenant, I won't stay captain--so there!"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Three cheers for the captain!" cried the boys; and there was another
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,uproar.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,And how did Fred feel towards the fearless, out-spoken Willy? Very
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,angry, of course; but, if you will believe me, he respected him more
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,than ever. Pompous boys are often mean-spirited and cowardly; they will
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,browbeat those who are afraid of them; but those who look down on them
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,and despise them, they hold in the highest esteem. Willy had never
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,scrupled to tell Fred just what he thought of his conduct; and for that
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,very reason Fred liked him better than any other boy in town.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,But the Never-Give-Ups were growing decidedly noisy. After they learned
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,that the cider was their own, they must drink more of it, whether they
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,wanted it or not. The consequence was, they soon began to act
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,disgracefully.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Can't you have peace there, you young scamps?" said one of the big boys
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,from over the river.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Yes, we will have peace if we have to fight for it," replied the
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,captain, who had drawn the little hunchback Jock to his side, and was
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,darting glances at Abe Noonin as sharp as a cut-and-thrust sword.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Mr. Chase," said Dr. Hilton, struck with a new idea, "those boys act as
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,if they were drunk."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Why, how can they be?" returned Mr. Chase; "they've had nothing to
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,drink but innocent cider."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Any way," cried the doctor, "they are getting up a regular mob, and we
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,shall have to _quail_ it!"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Too true: it was necessary to quell the Never-Give-Ups, that orderly
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,artillery company, the pride of the town! Quell it, and order it off the
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,grounds!
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Dire disgrace! Their steps were unsteady and slow; their heads were
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,bowed, but not with grief, for, to say the truth, they did not fully
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,comprehend the situation.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"The little captain is the furthest gone of any of them," said Dr.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Hilton. Indeed, before he reached home he was unable to walk, and
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Stephen carried him into the house in his arms. Not that Willy had drunk
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,so much as some of the others, but it had affected him more.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Poor Mrs. Parlin! She had to know what was the matter with her boy; and
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,the shock was so great that she went to bed sick, and Mr. Parlin sent
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,for the doctor.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,When Willy came to his senses next morning, there was a guilty feeling
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,hanging over him, and his head ached badly. He crept down stairs, and
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,fixed his gaze first on the sanded floor of the kitchen, then on the
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,dresser full of dishes; but to look any one in the face he was ashamed.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,His mother was not at the table, and they ate almost in silence.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Now, young man," said Mr. Parlin, after breakfast, "you may walk out to
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,the barn with me." Willy had a dim idea that he had done something
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,wrong; but exactly what it was he could not imagine. He remembered
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,scolding Abe Noonin for hurting little Jock's feelings; was that what he
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,was to be punished for?
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Willy did not know he had been intoxicated. He was sure he did not like
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,that cider, yesterday, and had taken only a little of it. He supposed he
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,had eaten too much, and that was what had made him sick.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Off with your jacket, young man!"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Old Dick neighed, Towler growled, the sheep bleated; it seemed as if
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,they were all protesting against Willy's being whipped.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Now, sir," said Mr. Parlin, after a dozen hearty lashes, "shall I ever
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,hear of your getting drunk again?"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Why, father! I didn't--O, I didn't! I only took some cider--just two
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,mugfuls!" gasped Willy; "that's all; and you know you always _let_ me
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,drink cider."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Two mugfuls!" groaned Mr. Parlin, distressed at what he considered a
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,wilful lie; and the blows fell heavier and faster, while Willy's face
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,whitened, and his teeth shut together hard. Mr. Parlin had never acted
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,from purer motives; still Willy felt that the punishment was not just,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,and it only served to call up what the boys termed his "Indian sulks."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Angry and smarting with pain in mind and body, he walked off that
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,afternoon to the old red store. Fred was sitting under a tree, chewing
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,gum.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Had to take it, I guess, Billy?"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Yes, an awful whipping," replied Willy; "did you?"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Me? Of course not. Do you know how I work it? When father takes down
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,the cowhide, I look him right in the eye, and that scares him out of it.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,He _darsn't_ flog me!"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,This was a downright lie. Fred was as great a coward as ever lived, and
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,screamed at sight of a cowhide. He had been whipped for cheating about
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,the cider, but would not tell Willy so.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Willy looked at him with surprise and something like respect. He could
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,never seem to learn that Freddy's word was not to be trusted.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Well, I'll do so next time," cried he, his eyes flashing fire.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Look here," said Fred, crossing his knees, and looking important;
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"let's run away."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Why, Fred Chase! 'Twould be wicked!"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"'Twouldn't, either. Things ain't wicked when folks don't catch you at
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,it; and we can go where folks won't catch us, now I promise you."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Willy's heart leaped up with a strange joy. He would not run away, but
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,if Fred had a plan he wanted to hear it.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Why, where could we go?"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"To sea."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Poh! our Caleb got flogged going to sea."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"O, well, Captain Cutter never flogs. He's a nice man,--lives down to
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Casco Bay. And of all the oranges that ever you saw, and the guava
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,jelly, and the pine-apples! he's always sending them to mother."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"I never ate a pine-apple."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Didn't you? Well, come, let's go; Captain Cutter will be real glad to
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,see us; come, to-night; he'll treat us first rate."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"'My son, if sinners entice thee, consent thou not.'"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,It seemed as if Willy could hear his mother saying the words.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"You and I are the best kind of friends, Willy. We'd have a real nice
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,time, and come home when we got ready."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Willy did not respond to this. He did not care very much about
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Fred,--nobody did,--and if he should be persuaded to go with him, it
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,would not be from friendship, most certainly.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"I wouldn't go off and leave mother; 'twould be real mean: but sometimes
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,I don't like father one bit,--now, that's a fact," burst forth Willy,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,with a heaving breast. "I told him I didn't like your cider, and didn't
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,take but two mugfuls; but he didn't believe a word I said."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"You're a fool to stand it, Billy."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"I won't stand it again--so there!"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"There, that's real Injun grit," said Fred, approvingly; "stick to it."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Father thinks children are foolish; he hates to hear 'em talk," pursued
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Willy; "and then, when you don't talk, he says you're sulky."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Well, if you go off he won't get a chance to say it again."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"O, but you see, Fred--"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Pshaw! you _darsn't_!"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Now, _you're_ not the one to call me a coward, Fred Chase."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Well, if you _dars_, then come on."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Willy did not answer. He was deliberating; and I wish you to understand
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,that in a case like this "the child that deliberates is lost."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Without listening to any more of the boys' conversation, we will go
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,right on to the next chapter, and see what comes of it.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,CHAPTER X.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,GOING TO SEA.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Seven o'clock was the time appointed to meet, and Willy watched the tall
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,clock in the front entry with a dreadful sinking at the heart. His
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,mother was not at the supper-table and he was glad of that. Ever since
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,muster she had staid in her room, suffering from a bad toothache. As her
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,face was tied up, and she could not talk, Willy was not quite sure how
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,she felt.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"How can I tell whether she has been crying or not? Her eyes are
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,swelled, any way. Perhaps she doesn't care much. She used to love me,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,but she thinks I act so bad now that it's no use doing anything with
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,me. I can't make her understand it at all."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,It was a pity he thought of his mother just then, for it was hard
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,enough, before that, swallowing his biscuit.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"She said to me, out in the orchard, one day,--says she, 'Willy, if a
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,boy wants to do wrong, he'll find some way to do it;' and I s'pose she
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,was thinking about me when she said it. S'pose she thinks I'm going to
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,be bad--mother does. Well, then, I ought to go off out of the way; she
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,doesn't want me here; what does she want of a bad boy? She'll be glad to
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,get rid of me; so'll Love."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,You see what a hopeless tangle Willy's mind was in. What ailed his
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,biscuit he could not imagine, but it tasted as dry as ashes.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Why, sonny," said Stephen, "what are you staring at your plate so for?
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,That's honey. Ever see any before?"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"This is the last chance Steve will have to pester me," thought the
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,child; and he almost pitied him.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Guess he'll feel sorry he's been so hard on a little fellow like me."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,As for grown-up Seth, it was certain that _his_ conscience would prick,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,and on the whole Willy was rather glad of it, for Seth had no right to
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,correct him so much. "Only eighteen, and not my father either!"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Willy did not think much about himself, and how he would be likely to
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,feel after he had left this dear old home--the home where every
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,knot-hole in the floor was precious. It would not do to brood over that;
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,and besides, there was sullen anger enough in his heart to crowd out
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,every other feeling.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,There were circles in the wood of the shed-door which he had made with a
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,two-tined fork; and after supper he made some more, while waiting for a
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,chance to pocket a plate of doughnuts. Of course it wasn't wrong to take
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,doughnuts, when it was the last morsel he should ever eat from his
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,mother's cupboard. He had the whole of eighteen cents in his leathern
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,wallet; but that sum might fail before winter, and it was best to take a
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,little food for economy's sake.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,At quarter of seven he put on his cap, and was leaving the house, when
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,his father said, severely,--
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Where are you going, young man?"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Mr. Parlin did not mean to be severe, but he usually called Willy a
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"young man" when he was displeased with him.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Going to the post-office, sir, just as I always do."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Willy spoke respectfully,--he had never done otherwise to his
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,father,--and Mr. Parlin little suspected the tempest that was raging in
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,the child's bosom.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Very well; go! but don't be gone long."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"'_Long?_' Don't know what he calls long," thought the little boy.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"P'raps I'll be gone two years; p'raps I'll be gone ten. Calls me a
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,'young man' after he has whipped me. Guess I _will_ be a young man
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,before I get back! Guess there won't be any more horsewhippings then!"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,And, dizzy with anger, he walked fast to the post office, without
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,turning his head.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Fred was there, anxiously waiting for him. The two boys greeted each
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,other with a meaning look, and soon began to move slowly along towards
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,the guide-board at the turn of the road.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,To the people who happened to be looking that way, it seemed natural
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,enough that Willy and Fred should be walking together. If anybody
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,thought twice about the matter, it was Dr. Hilton; and I dare say he
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,supposed they were swapping jack-knives.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,As soon as they were fairly out of sight of the village, Fred said,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,sneeringly,--
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Well, I've been waiting most half an hour--I suppose you know. Began to
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,think you'd sneaked out of it, Bill."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,There is an insult in the word 'sneak' that no boy of spirit can bear,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,and Willy was in no mood to be insulted.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Fred Chase," said he, bristling, "I'll give you one minute to take that
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,back."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"O, I didn't mean anything, Billy; only you was so awful slow, you
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,know."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Slow, Fred Chase! You needn't call _me_ slow! Bet you I can turn round
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,three times while you're putting out one foot."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,It is plain enough, from the tone of this conversation, that the boys
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,had not started out with that friendly feeling, which two travellers
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,ought to have for each other, who are intending to take a long journey
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,in company. Fred saw it would not do for Willy to be so cross in the
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,very beginning. He had had hard work to get the boy's consent to go, and
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,now, for fear he might turn back, he suddenly became very pleasant.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Look here, Billy; you can beat me running; I own up to that; but we've
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,got to keep together, you know. Don't you get ahead of me--now will
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,you?"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"I'll try not to," replied Willy, somewhat softened; "but you do get out
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,of breath as easy as a chicken."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Most time to begin to run?" said Fred, after they had trudged on for
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,some time at a moderate pace.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"No; there's a man coming this way," replied the sharper-eyed Willy.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"O, yes; I see him now. Who suppose it is?"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Why, Dr. Potter, of course. Don't you know him by his _shappo brar_?"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,The _chapeau bras_ was a three-cornered hat, the like of which you and I
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,have never seen, except in very old pictures.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,As Dr. Potter met the boys, he shook his ivory-headed cane, and said,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,playfully, "Good evening, my little men."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Good evening, sir."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,But it was certainly a bad evening inside their hearts, sulky and dark.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"What if Dr. Potter should tell where he met us?" exclaimed Fred. "Lucky
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,'twasn't Dr. Hilton.--There, he's out of the way; now let's run."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,They were on the road to Cross Lots, a town about five miles from
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Perseverance. They had not as yet marked out their course very clearly,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,but thought after they should reach Cross Lots it would be time enough
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,to decide what to do next.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,They ran with all their might, but did not make the speed they desired,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,for they jumped behind the fences whenever they heard a wagon coming,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,and were obliged to stop often, besides, for Freddy to take breath. By
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,the time they reached Cross Lots--a thriving little town with a
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,saw-mill--it was pretty late; and if it had not been for the bright
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,light of the moon and stars, they might have been a little disheartened.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,They took a seat on a stump near the saw-mill, and prepared to talk over
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,the situation. A lonesome feeling had suddenly come upon them, which
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,caused them to gaze wistfully upon the "happy autumn fields" and the
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,far-off sky.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Stars look kind o' shiny--don't they?" said Fred, heaving a sigh.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Willy forced a gay tone.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"What s'pose makes 'em keep up such a winking? Like rows of pins, you
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,know,--gold pins; much as a million of 'em, and somebody sticking 'em
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,into a great blue cushion up there, and keeps a-sticking 'em in, but out
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,they come again."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"I never heard of such a silly idea in my life," sneered Fred.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Pins!--H'm!"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Why, can't you tell when a fellow's in fun, Fred Chase? Thought I meant
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,real pins--did you? The stars are worlds, and I guess I know it as well
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,as you do."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Worlds? A likely story, Bill Parlin! Mother has said so lots of times,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,but you don't stuff such a story down _my_ throat."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Don't believe your mother!" exclaimed Willy, astonished. "Why, I always
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,believe my mother. She never made a mistake in her life."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Fred laughed.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"She don't know any more'n anybody else, you ninny! only you think so
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,because she makes such a baby of you."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Willy reddened with sudden shame, but retorted sharply,--
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Stop that! You shan't say a word against my mother."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"But you let me talk about your father, though. What's the difference?"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Lots. You may talk about father as much as you've a mind to," said
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Willy, scowling; "for he no business to whip me so. He thinks boys are
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,pretty near fools."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"That's just what my father thinks," returned Fred.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Whereupon the two boys were friends again, having got back to their one
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,point of agreement.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"If I had a boy I wouldn't treat him so,--now I tell you," said Willy,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,clinching his little fists. "I'd let him have a good time when he's
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,young."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"So'd I!"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"For when he's old he won't want to have a good time."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"That's so."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"And I wouldn't be stingy to him; I'd let him have all the money he
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,could spend."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"So'd I," responded the ungrateful Fred, who had probably had more
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,dollars given him to throw away than any other boy in the county.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"I'd treat a boy real well. I wouldn't make him work as tight as he
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,could put in," pursued Willy, overcome with dreadful recollections.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Nor I, neither! Guess I wouldn't!"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Poh! what do you know about it, Fred? Your father's rich, and don't
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,keep a pig!"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"What if he don't? What hurt does a pig do?"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Why, you have to carry out swill to 'em. Then there's the wood-box, and
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,there's the corn to husk, and the cows to bring up! It makes a fellow
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,ache all over."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"No worse'n errands, Bill! Guess you never came any nearer blistering
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,your feet than I did last summer, time we had so much company. Mother's
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,a case for thinking up errands."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Well, Fred, we've started to run away."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Should think it's likely we had."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"I'm going 'cause I can't stand it to be whipped any more; but you don't
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,get whipped, Fred. What are _you_ going for?"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Why, to seek my fortune," replied Fred, spitting, in a manly fashion,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,into a clump of smartweed. "Always meant to, you know, soon's I got so I
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,could take care of myself; and now I can cipher as far as
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,_substraction_, what more does a fellow want?"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Don't believe you can spell 'phthisic,' though."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,As this remark had nothing to do with the case in point, Fred took no
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,notice of it. What if he couldn't spell as well as Willy? He was a year
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,and a half older, and had the charge of this expedition.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Which way you mean to point, Billy?"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Why, I thought we were going to sea. That's what you said; and I put a
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,lot of nutcakes in my pocket to eat 'fore we got to the ship."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"You did? Well, give us some, then, for I'm about starved."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"So'm I, too."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,And one would hardly have doubted it, to see them both eat. The
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,doughnuts were sweet and spicy, and cheering to the spirits; the young
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,travellers did not once stop to consider that they might need them more
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,by and by. Children are not, as a general rule, very deeply concerned
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,about the future. Birds of the air may have some idea where to-morrow's
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,dinner is coming from; but these boys neither knew nor cared.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"First rate," remarked Fred, as the last doughnut disappeared. "But I
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,don't know about going to sea. It's plaguy tough work climbing ropes,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,they say, and I heard of a boy that got whipped so hard he jumped
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,overboard."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Let's not go, then," cried Willy.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Catch me!" said Fred. "I've been thinking of the lumb'ring business.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,They make money fast as you can wink up there to the Forks."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Let's go lumbering, then."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Guess we will, Billy. You see the trees don't cost anything,--they grow
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,wild,--and all you've got to do is to chop 'em down."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Yes," said Willy, "and we need red shirts for that. I never chopped a
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,tree's I know of. Could, though, if I had a sharp axe. Guess I could, I
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,mean,--I mean if the tree wasn't _too_ big!"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"O, we shan't chop 'em ourselves," said Fred, spitting grandly. "Wasn't
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,my father a lumberman once, and got rich by it? But did _he_ ever cut
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,down a tree? What's the use? Hire men, you know."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"O!" exclaimed Willy. But a gleam of common sense striking him next
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,moment, he added, "but the money; where'll we get that?"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"O, we'll get it after a while," replied Fred, vaguely. "My father was a
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,poor boy once. Fact! I've heard him tell about it. Nothing but tow-cloth
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,breeches, and wale-cloth jacket, off there to Groton. And he made butter
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,tubs and potash tubs, sir. And he took his pay in beaver skins. And then
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,he went afoot to Boston, and he rolled a barrel of lime round the Falls,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,sir. I've heard him tell it five million times. And my aunt Tempy, she
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,rode a-horseback three hundred miles to Concord.--O, poh! there's lots
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,of ways to make money, if you try. And once he took his pay in
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,potash,--my father did; and he sold tobacco. O, there's ways enough to
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,make money if you keep your eyes open; that's what my father says."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Willy's eyes were open enough, if that were all. At any rate, he was
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,trying his very best to keep them open. Half of his mind was sleepy, and
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,half of it very wide awake indeed. There was something so inspiring in
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Fred's confident tone. Rather misty his plans might be as yet; but
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,hadn't Willy heard, ever since he could remember, that people were sure
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,to succeed if they were only "up and doing?"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Come, let's start," said he, rising eagerly, as the bell rang for nine.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"If we are going to the Forks we must go to Harlow first; I know that
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,much."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,And turning the corner at the left, the two wise little pilgrims set out
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,upon their travels,--
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,    "Strange countries for to see."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,CHAPTER XI.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,TO THE FORKS.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Willy started upon the run; but Fred, as soon as he could overtake him,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,and speak for puffing, exclaimed,--
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Now, Will Parlin, what's the use? We've got a good start, and let's
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,take it fair and easy."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,This was the most sensible remark Fred had made for the evening. Lazy
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,and good-for-nothing as he was, he had spoken the truth for once. If
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,they were ever to arrive at the Forks, they were likely to do it much
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,sooner by walking than running. Willy did not understand this. Being as
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,lithe as a young deer, he preferred "bounding over the plains" to
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,lagging along with such a slow walker as Fred.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,The town of Harlow was twelve miles away, and it was Fred's opinion that
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,they should reach it in season for an early breakfast.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"I've got two dollars in my pocket," said he, "and I guess we shan't
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,starve _this_ fall."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Willy thought of the eighteen cents he had been six weeks in saving, but
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,was ashamed to speak of such a small sum.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Well, we shan't get to Harlow, or any where else, till day after
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,to-morrow afternoon, if you don't hurry up," said he, impatiently. "You
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,say you can't run, but I should think you might do as much as to march.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Now, come,--left, foot out,--while I whistle."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Fred tried his best, but he was one of the few boys born with "no music
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,in his soul," and he could not keep step.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"What's the matter with you, Fred Chase?"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Don't know. Guess you haven't got the right tune."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Willy stopped short in "Come, Philander," and turned it into "Hail,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Columbia;" but it made no difference. "Roy's Wife," or "Fy! let us a' to
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,the wedding," was as good as anything else. Fred took long steps or
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,short steps, just as it happened, and Willy never had understood, and
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,could not understand now, what did ail Fred's feet; it was very
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,tiresome, indeed.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Look here: what tune have I been whistling now? See if you know?"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Why, that's--that's--some kind of a dancing tune. Can't think. O, yes;
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,'Old Hundred.'"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Fred Chase!" thundered Willy; "that's _'Yankee Doodle_!' Anybody that
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,don't know Yankee Doodle _must_ be a fool!"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Why, look here now: I know Yankee Doodle as well as you do, Will
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Parlin, only you didn't whistle it right!"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,At another time Willy would have been quick to laugh at such an absurd
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,remark; but now, tired as he was, it made him downright angry. He
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,stopped whistling, and did not speak again for five minutes. Meanwhile
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,he began to grow very sleepy.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Wish we were going to battle," said Fred at last, for the sake of
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,breaking the silence. "I'd like to be in a good fight; that is, if they
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,had decent music. I could march to a fife and drum first rate."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Could, hey! Then why didn't you ever do it?"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Do you mean to say I don' know how to march? Know how as well as you
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,do."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Think's likely," snarled Willy, "for _I_ can't march if I have _you_ to
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,march with. Can't keep step with anybody that ain't bright!"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Nor I can't, either, Will Parlin; that's why I can't keep step with
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,you."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Well, then, go along to the other side of the road--will you? I won't
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,have you here with your hippity-hop, hippity-hop."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Go to the other side of the road your own self, and see how you like
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,it," retorted Fred. "I won't have _you_ here, with your tramp, tramp,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,tramp."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Was ever anybody so provoking as Fred? Willy had an impulse to give him
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,a hard push; but before he could extend his arm to do it, he had
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,forgotten what they were quarrelling about. That strange sleepiness had
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,drowned every other feeling, and Fred's "tramp, tramp, tramp," spoken in
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,such drawling tones, had fairly caused his eyes to draw together.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Guess I'll drop down here side of the road, and rest a minute," said
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,he.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"So'll I," said Fred, always ready for a halt if not for a march.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,But it was a cold night. As soon as they had thrown themselves upon the
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,faded grass they began to feel the pinchings of the frost.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"None of your dozing yet a while," said Fred, who, though tired, was not
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,as sleepy as Willy. "We must push along till we get to a barn or
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,something."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Willy rose to his feet, promptly.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Look up here and show us your eyes, Billy. I've just thought of
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,something. How do I know but you're sound asleep this minute? Generally
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,sleep with your eyes open--don't you--and walk round too, just the
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,same?"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Fred said this with a cruel laugh. He knew Willy was very sensitive on
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,the subject of sleep-walking, and he was quite willing to hurt his
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,feelings. Why shouldn't he be? Hadn't Willy hurt _his_ feelings by
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,making those cutting remarks in regard to music? As for the Golden Rule,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Master Fred was not the boy to trouble himself about that; not in the
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,least.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"I haven't walked in my sleep since I was a small boy," said Willy,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,trying his best to force back the tears; "and I don't think it's fair
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,to plague me about it now."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Well, then, you needn't plague me for not keeping step to your old
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,whistling. If you want to know what the reason is I can't keep step,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,I'll tell you; it's because my feet are sore. They've been tender ever
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,since I blistered 'em last summer."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Willy was too polite this time, or perhaps too sleepy, to contradict.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,It did seem as if the road to Harlow was the longest, and the hills the
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,steepest, ever known.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Call it twelve miles--it's twenty!" said Fred, beginning to limp.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Would be twenty-five," said Willy, "if the hills were rolled out
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,smooth."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,They trudged on as bravely as they could, but, in spite of the cold, had
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,to stop now and then to rest, and by the time they had gone eight miles
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,it seemed as if they could hold out no longer.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"I shouldn't be tired if I were in your place," said Fred; "it's my
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,feet, you know."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Here's a barn," exclaimed Willy, joyfully.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Hush!" whispered cautious Fred; "don't you see there's a house to it,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,and it wouldn't do to risk it? Folks would find us out, sure as guns."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,A little farther on there was a hayrack at the side of the road, filled
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,with boards; and after a short consultation the boys decided to climb
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,into it, and "camp down a few minutes."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"It won't do to stay long," said Fred, "for it must be 'most sunrise;
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,and we should be in a pretty fix if anybody should go by and catch us."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,It was only one o'clock! The boards were not as soft as feathers, by any
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,means, but the boys thought they wouldn't have minded that if they could
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,only have had a blanket to spread over them. More forlorn than the
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"babes in the wood," they had not even the prospect that any birds would
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,come and cover them with leaves.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,As they stretched themselves upon the boards, Willy thought of his
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,prayer. "Now I lay me down to sleep." Never, since he could remember,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,had he gone to bed without that. Would it do to say it now? Would God
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,hear him? Ah, but would it do _not_ to say it? So he breathed it softly
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,to himself, lest Fred should hear and laugh at him.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,It was so cold that Fred declared he couldn't shut his eyes, and
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,shouldn't dare to, either; but in less than a minute both the boys were
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,fast asleep.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,They had slept about three hours, without stirring or even dreaming,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,when they were suddenly wakened by the glare of a tin lantern shining in
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,their eyes, and a gruff voice calling out,--
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Who's this? How came you here?"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Willy stared at the man without speaking. Was it to-night, or last
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,night, or to-morrow night?
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Fred had not yet opened his eyes, and the worthy farmer was obliged to
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,shake him for half a minute before he was fairly aroused.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Who are you? What are you here for?" repeated he.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Then the boys sat upright on the boards and looked at each other. They
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,were both covered with a thick coating of frost, as white as if they had
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,been out in a snowstorm. What should they say to the man? It would never
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,do to tell him their real names, for then he would very likely know who
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,their fathers were, and send them straight home. Dear! dear! What a pity
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,they happened to fall asleep! And why need the man have come out there
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,in the night with a lantern?--a man who probably had a bed of his own to
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,sleep in.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"I--I--" said Willy, brushing the frost off his knees; and that is
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,probably as far as he would have gone with his speech, for his tongue
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,failed him entirely; but Fred, being afraid he might tell the whole
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,truth,--which was a bad habit of Willy's,--gave him a sly poke in the
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,side, as a hint to stop. Willy couldn't and wouldn't make up a wrong
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,story; but Fred could, and there was nothing he enjoyed more.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Well, sir," said he, clearing his throat, and looking up at the farmer
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,with a face of baby-like innocence, "I guess you don't know me--do you?
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,My name's Johnny Quirk, and this boy here's my brother, Sammy Quirk."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Willy drew back a little. It seemed as if he himself had been telling a
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,lie. Ah! and wasn't it next thing to it?
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Quirk? Quirk? I don't know any Quirks round in these parts," said the
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,farmer.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"O, we live up yonder," said Fred, pointing with his finger. "We live
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,two miles beyond Harlow, and we were down to Cross Lots to aunt
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Nancy's, you see, and they sent for us to come home,--mother did. Our
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,father's dreadful sick: they don't expect he'll get well."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"You don't say so! Poor little creeturs! And here you are out doors,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,sleeping on the rough boards. Come right along into the house with me,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,and get warm. What's the matter with your father?"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Some kind of a fever; and he don't know anything; he's awful sick,"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,replied Fred, running his sleeve across his eyes.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,The good farmer's heart was touched. He thought of his own little boys,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,no older than these, and how sad it would be if they should be left
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,fatherless.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Come in and get warm," said he. "It's four o'clock, and you shall sleep
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,in a good bed till six, and then I'll wake you up, and give you some
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,breakfast."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"O, I don't know as we can; we ought to be going," said Fred, wiping his
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,eyes; "father may be dead."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Yes, but you shall come in," persisted the farmer; "you're all but
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,froze. If 'twas my little boys, I should take it kindly in anybody that
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,made 'em go in and get warm. Besides, you can travel as fast again if
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,you start off kind of comfortable."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,A good bed was so refreshing to think of that the boys did not need much
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,urging; but Willy entered the house with downcast eyes and feelings of
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,shame, whereas Fred could look their new friend in the face, and answer
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,all his questions without wincing.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Mr. Johonnet thought himself a shrewd man, but he could not see into the
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,hearts of these young children. He liked the appearance of "Johnny
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Quirk," an "open-hearted, pretty-spoken little chap, that any father
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,might be proud of;" but "Sammy" did not please him as well; he was not
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,so frank, or so respectful,--seemed really to be a little sulky. There
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,are some boys who pass off finely before strangers, because they are not
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,in the least bashful, and have a knack of putting on any manner they
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,choose; and Fred was one of these. Willy, a far nobler boy, was
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,naturally timid before his betters; but even if he had been as bold as
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Fred, his conscience would never have let him say and do such untrue
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,things.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Willy suffered. Although he had told no lies himself, he had stood by
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,and heard them told without correcting them. How much better was that?
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Still it seemed as if, as things were, he could not very well have
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,helped himself. So much for falling into bad company. "Eggs should not
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,dance with stones."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Well; I never'd have come with Fred Chase if father hadn't whipped me
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,'most to death."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,And, soothed with this flimsy excuse, Willy was soon asleep again.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,At six o'clock Mr. Johonnet called the little travellers to breakfast.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,The coffee was very dark-colored, with molasses boiled in it, and there
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,were fried pork, fried potatoes swimming in fat, and clammy "rye and
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,indian bread." None of these dishes were very inviting to the boys, who
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,both had excellent fare at home; and they would have made but a light
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,meal, if it had not been for the pumpkin pie and cheese, which Mr.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Johonnet asked his wife to set on the table.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Poor children, they must eat," said he; "for they've got to get home to
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,see their sick father."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,There were so many questions to be asked, that the boys made quick work
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,of their breakfast and hurried away.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"There, glad we're out of that scrape," said Fred.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"But _didn't_ you lie? Why, Fred, how could you lie so?"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"H'm! Did it up handsome--didn't I, though? Wouldn't give a red cent for
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,you. You haven't the least gumption about lying."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Willy shivered and drew away a little. His fine nature was shocked by
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Fred's coarseness and lack of principle; still, this was the boy he had
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,chosen for an intimate friend!
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"If it hadn't been for me you'd have let the cat out of the bag,"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,chuckled Fred. "You hung your head down as if you'd been stealing a
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,sheep."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,It was three miles farther to Harlow, and Fred grumbled all the way
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,about his sore feet.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"See that yellow house through the trees?" said he. "That's my uncle
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Diah's; wish we could go there and rest."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"But what's the use to wish?" returned Willy. "Look here, Fred; isn't
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,there a ford somewhere near here?"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,To be sure there was. They had forgotten that; and sometimes the ford
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,was not fordable, and it was necessary to go round-about in order to
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,cross a ferry. While they were puzzling over this new dilemma, a
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,stage-horn sounded.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"That's the Harlow driver; he knows us," cried Fred; "let's hide quick."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,They concealed themselves behind some aspen trees on the bank, and
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"peeking" out, could see the stage-coach and its four sleek horses,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,about an eighth of a mile away, driving down the ferry-hill into the
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,river.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Good!" said Willy; "there's the ford, and now we know. And the water
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,isn't up to the horses' knees; so _we_ can cross well enough."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Yes, and get our breeches wet," groaned Fred.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"O, that's nothing. Lumbermen don't mind wet breeches," said Willy,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,cheerily.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Lumbermen? Who said we were lumbermen? I shan't try it yet a while; my
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,feet are too plaguy sore!"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Shan't try what?"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Well, nothing, I guess," yawned Fred; "lumber nor nothing else."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,The stage had passed, by this time, and they were walking towards the
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,ford. When they reached it, Willy, nothing daunted, drew off his
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,stockings and shoes, and began to roll up his pantaloons.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Look here, Billy; if you see any fun in this business, _I_ don't!"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Fun? O, but we don't spect that, you know," said heroic Willy, stepping
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,into the stream.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Cold as ice, I know by the way you cringe," said lazy Fred, who had not
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,yet untied his shoes.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Come on, Fred; who minds the cold?"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Now wait a minute, Billy. I hadn't got through talking. I'm not going
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,to kill myself for nothing; I want some fun out of it."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Do come on and behave yourself," called back Willy; "when we get rich
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,we'll have the fun."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Well, go and get rich then," cried Fred; "I shan't stir another step!
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,My father's got money enough, and I needn't turn my hand over."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Willy stopped short.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"But you are going to the Forks with me?"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Who said I was?"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Why, you said so, yourself. You were the one that put it in my head."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"O, that was only talk. I didn't mean anything."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Willy turned square round in the water, and glared at Fred, with eyes
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,that seemed to shoot sparks of fire.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,[Illustration: DESERTED.--Page 195.]
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Yes--well, yes, I did kind of mean to, too," cried Fred, shrinking
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,under the gaze; "but I've got awful sick of it."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Who called me a SNEAK?" exclaimed Willy, his voice shaking with wrath.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Who called me my mamma's cry-baby? Who said he spected I'd back out?"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"But you see, Billy, my feet!"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Willy, whose own feet were nearly freezing, replied by a sniff of
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,contempt. He planted himself on a rock in the middle of the river, and
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,awaited the rest of Fred's speech.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"You know I've got folks living this side, back there a piece--my uncle
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Diah. That's where I'll go. They'll let me make a visit, and carry me
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,home: they did it last spring."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"And what about _me_, Fred Chase?"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"You? Why, you may go where you're a mind to."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"What? Me, that you coaxed so to come?"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Fred quailed before the look and the tone.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Well, I'd take you to uncle Diah's, Willy, only--well--I can't very
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,well, that's all."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Willy suddenly turned his back, and cleared the stream with one bound.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,

little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,CHAPTER XII.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"I HA'E NAEBODY NOW."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Standing on the bank, Willy looked back over his shoulder at Fred, and
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,saw him dart off into a shady cow-path. No doubt he was going to his
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,uncle Diah's. When he was fairly out of sight, and Willy comprehended at
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,last that he had really left him, and did not mean to come back, he sat
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,down on a stone by the wayside, and began to rave.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"The tormentable, mean, naughty boy! I'd be ashamed to treat a _skeeter_
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,the way he's treated me! Did I ever coax a boy to go anywhere with me,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,and then run off and leave him right in the middle of the river? No,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,_sir_. Sore feet, hey? Didn't anybody ever have sore feet 'fore now, I
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,wonder? Why, I had chilblains last winter so deep they dug a hole into
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,my heels, and,--well, it's no use to make a great fuss,--I didn't cry
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,but two or three times. Blisters! what's that? Nothing but little puffs
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,of water! Perhaps that wasn't why he stopped, though. Just as likely as
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,not he meant all the time to stop, and come a-purpose to see Mr. Diah.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,How can you tell? A boy that lies so! There, there, come to think of it,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,shouldn't wonder if his feet weren't sore a bit! Wish I'd looked at 'em!
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Well, he's backed out, Fred Chase has! I should think he'd feel so mean
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,he never'd want to show _his_ head anywhere again! 'Fore I'd _sneak
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,out_ when I got started! Eh, for shame!"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Willy tore up a handful of grass, and threw it into the road, and the
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,action served to relieve him a little.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Well, what'll _I_ do? now let's think. If a tiger should come right
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,down this ferry-hill, and tear me all to pieces, Fred wouldn't care.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,'Course not. All he cares is to get enough to eat, and not make his feet
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,sore. He don't care what comes of me. I've got to think it out for
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,myself, what I'd better do. Got to do it myself, too, all alone, and
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,there won't be anybody to help me. Pretty scrape, I should think! Might
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,have known better'n to come!
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Well; will I be a lumberman and go up to the Forks? Let's see; I don'
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,know the way up there. That makes it bad, 'cause I guess there isn't
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,much of any road to it 'cept spotted trees; that's what I heard once.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Most likely I'd get lost. Fred wouldn't care if I did; be glad, I
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,s'pose. But, then, there's bears. Ugh! Pshaw! who's afraid of bears? And
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,then there's mother--O, I didn't mean to think about mother!"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Willy sighed, but soon roused himself.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Well, what'll I do? O, wasn't that a real poor breakfast the woman gave
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,us? Don't see how I swallowed it! Makes me sick to think of it. Didn't
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,taste much like mother's breakfasts! I don't want to go where I'll have
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,to drink molasses in my coffee, and eat fatty potatoes too.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"And who'd take a little boy like me? Folks laugh at little boys--think
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,they don't know a thing. And folks always ask so many questions. They
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,want to know where you come from, and who your father is, and if he's
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,got any cows. And I _won't_ lie. And next thing they'd be sending me
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,home. They'd say home was the best place for little boys. H'm! So it is,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,if you don't have to get whipped!
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"O, my! Didn't I have to take it that last time? Father never hurt so
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,before. Made all the bad come up in my throat, and I can't swallow it
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,down yet. It would be good enough for him if I was dead; for then every
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,time he went out to the barn there'd be that horsewhip hanging up on the
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,nail; and he'd think to himself--'Where's that little boy I used to
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,whip?' And then the tears will come into his eyes, I pretty much know
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,they will. I saw the tears in his eyes once when I was sick. He felt
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,real bad; but when I got well, first thing he did was to whip me again.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Whippings don't do any good. All that does any good is when mother talks
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,to me; and that don't do any good, either. She made me learn this
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,verse:--
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"'And thou, Solomon, my son, know thou the God of thy fathers, and serve
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,him with a perfect heart and a willing mind. If thou seek him, he will
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,be found of thee, but if thou forsake him, he will cast thee off
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,forever.'
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"There, I know that straight as a book. She prays to God to make me
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,better, but He doesn't do it yet, and I should think she'd get
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,discouraged. 'Heart like a stone,' she said. That made me want to laugh,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,for I could feel it beating all the time she spoke, and it couldn't if
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,it was a stone! Bad heart, though, or I wouldn't be so bad myself.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Well, it's no use to think about badness or goodness now," said Willy,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,flinging another handful of grass into the road. "_What'll I do?_ That's
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,the question.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"You see, now, folks have such a poor opinion of boys," added he, his
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,thoughts spinning round the same circle again. "Most wish I was a girl.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,O, my stars, what an idea!"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,And completely disgusted with himself, he jumped up and turned a
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,somerset.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Better be whipped three times a day than be a girl!
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"But father felt real bad that time I was sick, for I saw him. Not so
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,bad as mother, though. Poor mother! I no business to gone off and left
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,her. What you s'pose she thought last night, when I didn't come back
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,from the post office?"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,This question had tried to rise before, but had always been forced back.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"She waited till nine o'clock, and didn't think much queer. But after
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,that she come out of the bedroom, with her face tied up, and said she,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,'Hasn't Willy got home yet?' Then they told her 'No,' and father
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,scowled. And she sat up till ten o'clock, and then do you s'pose anybody
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,went out doors to hunt? She didn't sleep a wink all night. Don't see how
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,folks can lie awake so. I couldn't if I should try; but I'm not a woman,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,you know, and I don't believe I should care much about my boys, if I
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,was. Would _I_ mend their trousis for 'em, when they tore 'em on a nail,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,going where I told 'em not to? For, says I, I can't bear the sight of a
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,child that won't mind. But you see, mother--
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Poor mother, what'll she do without me? She said there wasn't anybody
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,she could take in her arms to hug but just me. Stephen's too big to sit
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,in her lap, and Love's too big; and there wouldn't anybody think of
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,hugging Seth, if he was ever so little.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Yes, mother wants _me_. I remember that song she sings about the Scotch
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,woman that lost her baby, and she cries a little before she gets
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,through."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,The words were set to a plaintive air, and Willy hummed it over to
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,himself,--
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,    "I ha'e naebody now, I ha'e naebody now
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,       To clasp at my bosom at even,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,    O'er his calm sleep to breathe out a vow,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,       And pray for the blessing of Heaven."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Poor mother, how that makes her cry! Why, I declare, I'm crying too!
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Somehow seems's if I couldn't get along without mother. But there, I
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,won't be a cry-baby! Hush up, Willy Parlin!
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"WHAT'LL I DO? Wish I hadn't come. Wish I'd thought more about
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,mother--how she's going to feel.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"What if I should turn right round now, and go home? Why, father'd whip
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,me worse'n ever--_that's_ what. Well, who cares? It'll feel better after
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,it's done smarting. Guess I can stand it. Look here, Will Parlin, I'm
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,going."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Bravo, Willy! With both feet he plunged into the river, and waded slowly
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,across. Very slowly, for his mind was not fully made up yet. There was a
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,great deal of thinking to be done first; but he might as well be moving
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,on while he thought. Every now and then rebellious pride, or anger, or
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,shame would get the better of him, and he would wheel round, with the
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,impulse to strike off into the unknown _Somewhere_, where boys lived
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,without whippings. But the thought of his mother always stopped him.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Was there an invisible cord which stretched from her heart to his--a
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,cord of love, which drew him back to her side? He could see her
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,sorrowful face, he could hear her pleading voice, and the very tremble
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,in it when she sang,--
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,    "I ha'e naebody now, I ha'e naebody now."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"But I'd never go back and take that whipping, if it wasn't for mother!"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,He no longer felt obliged to hide from the approach of every human
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,being; and when a pedler, driving a "cart of notions," called out, "Want
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,a lift, little youngster?" he was very glad to accept the offer. To be
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,sure, he only rode two or three miles, but it was a great help.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,It was noon, by that time, "high noon too," and the smell of nice
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,dinners floated out to him from the farm-houses, as he trudged by; but
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,to beg a meal he was ashamed. When he reached Cross Lots it was the
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,middle of the afternoon. He went up to the stump near the mill, where he
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,and Freddy had sat the night before; and, as he seated himself, he
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,thought with a pang of that pocket full of doughnuts, so freely made way
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,with.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,He had eighteen cents in his wallet; but what good did it do, when there
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,was no store at hand where a body could buy so much as a sheet of
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,gingerbread? He was starving in the midst of plenty, like that
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,unfortunate man whose touch turned all the food he put in his mouth into
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,gold.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Beginning to think he would almost be willing to be whipped for the sake
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,of a good supper, he rose and walked on.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,When he reached the Noonin farm, a mile and a half from home, the night
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,shadows were beginning to fall, but he could see in the distance a horse
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,and wagon coming that made his heart thump loud. The horse was old
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Dolly; and what if one of the men in the wagon should be his father?
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,No, it was only Seth and Stephen; but Seth was almost as much to be
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,dreaded as Mr. Parlin himself.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"You here, you young rogue?" called out Stephen, in a tone between
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,laughing and scolding, for he would not have Willy suspect how relieved
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,they were at finding him. "You here? And where's Fred?"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Up to Harlow, to Mr. Diah's," replied Willy, and coolly climbed into
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,the wagon.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Better wait for an invitation. How do you know we shall let you ride?"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,said Stephen, turning the horse's head towards home.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"First, we'd like to know what you've got to say for yourself," put in
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Seth, in that cold, hard tone, which always made Willy feel as if he
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,didn't care how he had acted, and as if he would do just so again.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"I suppose you are aware that you have been a very wicked, deceitful,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,disobedient boy?"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Willy made no reply, but lay down on the floor of the wagon, and curled
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,himself up like a caterpillar.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Don't be too hard on him, Seth," said Stephen, who could not help
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,pitying the poor little fellow in his shame and embarrassment; "I don't
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,believe you meant to run away--now did you, Willy?"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,The child was quite touched by this unexpected kindness. So they were
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,not sure he did mean to run away? If he said "No," they would believe
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,him, and then perhaps he wouldn't have to be whipped. But next instant
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,his better self triumphed, and he scorned the lie. Uncurling himself
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,from his caterpillar ball, he stammered,--
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Yes, I did mean to, too."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,A little more, and he would have told the whole story. He longed to
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,tell it--how life had seemed a burden on account of his whippings, and
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,how he and Fred had planned to set up in business for themselves, but
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Fred had backed out. But before he had time to speak, Seth said,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,sternly,--
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"You saucy child!"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,He had taken Willy's quick "Yes, I did mean to, too," for impertinence;
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,whereas it was one of the bravest speeches the boy ever made, and did
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,him honor.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,After this rebuke from Seth, Willy could not very well go on with his
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,confessions; the heart was gone out of him, and he curled up, limp and
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,quiet, like a caterpillar again.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Meant to run away--did you?" went on Seth, who ought to have known
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,better than to pursue the subject; "to run away like a little dirty
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,vagabond! You've nearly killed mother, I wish you to understand. You'll
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,get a severe thrashing for this. I shall tell father not to show you any
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,mercy."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Come, now, don't kick a fellow when he's down," said Stephen. "Willy
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,will be ashamed enough of this."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Well, he ought to be ashamed! If he'd had a teaspoonful of brains he'd
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,have known better than to cut up such a caper as this. Did you think you
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,could run off so far but that we could find you, child?"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,No answer.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"What did you little goslings mean to do with yourselves? Live on
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,acorns? And what did Fred's uncle say when he saw him coming into the
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,house in that shape?"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,No answer.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Stephen looked down at the curled-up bunch on the floor of the wagon,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,and as it did not move, he gently touched it with his foot.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Poor little thing," said he, "I guess he's had a pretty hard cruise of
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,it; he's sound asleep."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,

little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,CHAPTER XIII.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,CONCLUSION.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Mrs. Parlin saw the wagon driving up to the porch door, and came out
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,trembling and too much frightened to speak. She supposed at first that
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Willy had not come, for she did not see him till Seth and Stephen lifted
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,him out of the wagon, a dead weight between them.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,O, her baby--her baby; what had happened to her dear wee Willie?
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"There, there, mother, don't be frightened," said Stephen, cheerily;
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"his tramp has been too much for him; that's all. I guess we'll carry
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,him right up stairs to bed."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"I--want--some--supper," moaned the little rebel, waking up just as they
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,were laying him on his bed in the pink chamber.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,His mother and Love watched him with real pleasure, as he devoured cold
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,meat and bread, all they dared let him have, but not half as much as he
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,craved. Then he fell asleep again, and did not wake till noon of the
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,next day. His mother was bending over him with the tenderest love, just
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,as if he had never given her a moment's trouble in his life. That was
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,just like his dear mother, and it was more than Willy could bear; he
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,threw his arms round her neck, and buried his face in her bosom,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,completely subdued.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"O, mother, mother, I'll never do so again."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"My darling, I am sure you never will."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Where's father?"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Down stairs in the dining-room, I think."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Well, I'm ready; will you tell him I'm ready," cried Willy, drawing a
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,quick breath.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Ready for what, dear?"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Well, he is going to whip me, I suppose, and I want it over with."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"And how do you feel about it, my son? Don't you think you deserve to be
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,whipped?"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Yes'm, I do," replied Willy, with a sudden burst of candor; "I don't
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,see how anybody can help whipping a boy that's acted the way I have."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"That's nobly said, my child," exclaimed Mr. Parlin, stepping out of the
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,large clothes-press. "I happened to be in there over-hauling the trunk
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,that has my Freemason clothes in it, and I couldn't but overhear what
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,you've been saying."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Willy buried his face in the pillow. He was willing his mother should
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,know his inmost thoughts, but he had always been afraid of his father.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"And, Willy, since you take so kindly to the idea of another whipping, I
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,don't know but I shall let you off this time."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Willy opened his eyes very wide.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"I'll tell you why," went on Mr. Parlin. "You didn't deserve the last
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,whipping you had; so that will go to offset this one, which you do
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,deserve."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Willy's eyes sparkled with delight; still there was a look in them of
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,question and surprise. The idea of his ever having a whipping that his
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,father thought he didn't deserve!
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"You were in a shameful state that night, Willy; I can't call it
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,anything else but _drunk_; but I know now how it happened; there was
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,brandy in the cider."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Brandy, papa?"
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Yes. Dr. Potter and I examined the barrel yesterday, and the mixture in
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,it was at least one third brandy."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"O, papa, was that why it tasted so bad? I drank one mugful, and didn't
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,like it; and then by and by I drank another mugful; but that was all."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"Yes, Willy; so you told me when I talked with you; and I didn't believe
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,you then; but I believe you now."
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,"O, father, I'm so glad!" cried Willy, with a look such as he had never
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,before given his father--a beaming look of gratitude and love. I think
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,he was happier at that moment to know that his father trusted him, than

little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,He little thought then that he should never have another whipping as
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,long as he lived; but so it proved. Not that Mr. Parlin ever changed his
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,mind about the good effects of the rod; but when he saw that Willy was
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,really trying to be a better boy, he had more patience with him.
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,And Willy was trying. He continued to be rather hasty and headstrong,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,but the "Indian sulks" gradually melted out of his disposition like ice
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,in a summer river. This exploit of running away had a humbling effect,
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,no doubt; but more than that, as he grew older he learned to understand
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,and love his father better. He found that those dreadful whippings had
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,been given "more in sorrow than in anger,"--given as a help to make him
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,better; and the time came when he thanked his father for them.

little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,public support and donations to carry out its mission of

little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations

little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
little-grandfather,1833,may-sophie,with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
